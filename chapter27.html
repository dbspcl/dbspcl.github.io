<p>
    “Sister Artemis! I want you to know how thankful I am for this dinner.”
    Eleanor clapped. “How long has it been since we dined together in harmony?”
</p>
<p>
    “Too long. Trust me. Things have gotten so hectic around here, there’s just
    no time to bring us together like the good ol’ days. I just get so caught
    up in all this… <em>stuff.</em> Believe me, this feast is long overdue.”
</p>
<p>
    “And, of course, this is preceding a <em>suicide mission</em> into
uncharted waters, past the borders of Remnant, where you believe    <strong>Aku</strong> to be. Seems a little counter-intuitive, all in the
    name of <em>team training</em>, and information gathering. But isn’t
    venturing into the Grimm’s den the equivalent of self-immolation?” She
    gestured to a wall marred with maps and notes, each of the traces
    pinpointing one unobserved whirlpool too far off the coast. It was clear
    from the obsessive scribblings who their target was.
</p>
<p>
    Artemis smiled. “I’ve already thought about this. The Captain’s Eidolon’s
    are out, searching for us. That means Aku is completely unguarded. It’s
    only a matter of time before he joins the hunt, so now’s the time to
    strike. If I’m right about my hunches and he’s waiting there alone, we’ll
    see if he can take six Silver-Eyed Warriors at once.”
</p>
<p>
    <strong>“Six?”</strong>
    Mania seemed taken aback. “So even Sister <em>Diana</em> will join us?
    Isn’t that a little irresponsible? A Delphic of Aku’s reputation isn’t for
    the faint of heart. <em>I</em> can at least admire his campaign of
massacres, just for how gory they are, but it’s careless to expose a    <em>child</em> to it.”
</p>
<p>
    “I’m <em>not</em> a child.” Diana insisted. Artemis quelled her worries.
</p>
<p>
    “I’ve given her <em>special</em> instructions for this mission in private.
    Isn’t that right?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes. The full extent of my power is to be used. I won’t hold back! I know
    it sounds crazy, but I’m almost excited. Or anxious. I can’t tell which!”
</p>
<p>
    “We all felt the same for our first big forte into Grimm slaughtering.
    You’ve had your fair share of invasions, but this is completely different.
    Be on your toes.”
</p>
<p>
    “But that comes later tonight!” Eleanor cheered. “First, it’s time to set
    the table. Sister Mania! Would you be so kind as to place the silverware?”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Oh, it would be my pleasure!”</em>
    She gave an overenthusiastic reply in a high-pitched voice. Upon confusion
    over why she slammed down the cutlery with such force and precision, she
    simply responded, “Practice.”
</p>
<p>
    Nobody even realized Styx had <em>joined</em> the conversation until she
    started <em>speaking.</em> “Something smells good in here. What’s on the
    menu? Finally decided to cook up some blackened vultures, eh?”
</p>
<p>
    “Ah! I would <em>never!” </em>Artemis retrieved the roasted pig from an
    archaic oven, powered by wooden logs. “Be a dear and carve this thing, will
    you? And Sister Mania? Do you have to put down the silverware with such
    zest? You’re going to break the table.”
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t understand.” She admitted, slamming down another fork and rattling
    the platters of sides. “This is how I do everything.”
</p>
<p>
“Can we eat already?” Eos huffed, outshining Mania by shaking the entire    <em>table</em> just by sitting. “I’m starving.”
</p>
<p>
    “You’re always starving.”
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t fuss!” Styx accurately hacked the main course into chunks, her
    precise twirl of knives not only carving the meal, but rocketing every
    piece onto the nearby plates. She couldn’t help bowing at the applause.
</p>
<p>
    “Wait!” Artemis had to stop Eos from cleaning the plate in seconds. “Have
    you forgotten so soon? First, a prayer. Hold out your hands….
    <em>
        I revere our master, Lady Clotho, for the blessings bestowed upon our
        shelter. Thank you, for the bounty set before us by thou. It is through
        our allegiance that Remnant may rest, everlasting. Inculto.”
    </em>
    Each of them repeated the last word. “Dig in.”
</p>
<p>
    Hardly was it a <em>quiet</em> affair. The halls were abound with hurrahs,
    and conversation, though plentiful, sat completely secondary to constant
    joking and toasts.
</p>
<p>
    Mania was caught in the middle of one of her stories. “It’d already been a
    few hours since the hunt began. Therefore, I was stuck wearing Grimm pelts
    due to the cold, even over my face. So, I was too constricted to use
    weapons. I couldn’t even <em>talk.” </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Thank god.” Styx rolled her eyes, encouraged by giggling.
</p>
<p>
“Point is, a group of townspeople found me, and thought I was an    <em>Ursa.</em> So what do I do? I raise my arms and start jumping, but of
    course that just makes them <em>more</em> scared. I looked like a
    pincushion by the time I hit the floor. <em>Felt</em> like one, too.
    Probably one of the most humiliating experiences of the last century.”
</p>
<p>
    “What did you say when they finally pulled off the costume and saw you were
    a <em>person?” </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>“’Shoot me again.’” </em>
</p>
<p>
    More howling. As Diana laughed, her visor bounced up, and an arc of white
    energy zapped a set of knives across the room, into the disembodied head of
    a Boarbatusk mounted on the wall. Silence followed, then more laughter.
</p>
<p>
    “Haha! <em>Hey!</em> You gotta save some of that for <em>Aku,</em> I’m
    telling you!” Mania nudged her shoulder, while <em>she</em> could only
    reply by blushing. “Ugh. I forgot why none of you sat next to Sister Eos.
    This is like the wet and wild zone, right now.”
</p>
<p>
    “First time?” Eleanor said in true tedium, another splash of soup bouncing
    off the left side of her suit.
</p>
<p>
    “Ugh. Sorry.” Eos wiped her mouth and slammed down a mug.
</p>
<p>
    “Say… Is that ale?” Mania reached for the pitcher.
    <br/>
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
“Of course. Some sort of bounty award from Abigor. Guy couldn’t stomach a    <em>shot</em> of it. That’s a lightweight for you.”
</p>
<p>
    “I’m telling him you said that.” Eleanor remarked.
</p>
<p>
    “Why? <em>None</em> of you could hold your drinks.”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Here we go again.” </em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>“Can too!”</em></strong>
    Mania instantly poured herself an overflowing stein, and within seconds,
    the binge for supremacy commenced.
</p>
<p>
    “Ack! That’s disgusting!” Styx started gagging, and immediately backed away
    from the table. “Why does this stuff always have to smell so repulsive?”
</p>
<p>
    “Trust me, it <em>tastes</em> about as good.” While Mania and Eos competed
    to see who would pass out first, Eleanor reached for a hatchet on the
    table, and whispered to Diana,
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Psst! Wanna see something cool?”</em>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh? S-Sure.”
</p>
<p>
    “Watch this. I’ve been practicing my aim.” She chucked the hatchet across
    the atrium towards a target board. Hardly experienced in this area, she
    couldn’t have been more off the mark. But since it scooped a hunk off meat
off Artemis’ fork, she was able to partially save face. “Uh… See? I-I    <em>meant</em> to do that.”
</p>
<p>
    “Have you gone insane? You could’ve taken out my eye.” Their leader
    admonished.
</p>
<p>
    “That’ll be the day… ”
</p>
<p>
    Far past midnight, the only thing to suggest anyone had ever been in the
    dinette at all were the still smoking candles and plates stacked upon each
    other, topped with fresh crumbs and bones. Demeter, drenched with sea
    water, slammed open the doors with the Heirloom drawn. Quickly, she
    gathered the Coven’s plans, now scared for <em>them</em> at the realization
    of their quest.
    <em>
“W-What? Foolishness. You should have told me you were going to fight        <strong>him.</strong>
    </em>
    <strong>”</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Soon, she left to her new mediator, the scrawled sketches of Artemis in
    hand. “Did you tell them?” Abigor wheezed, completely exhausted from the
    trek back from Summit’s Blight, the sprint from the Keraseer Kingdom more
    taxing than usual. He knew one such as himself, a <em>human,</em> could not
    pass through to warn them himself. Requesting Demeter was a stroke of
    genius.
</p>
<p>
    “They weren’t there. They’ve left, to find Aku. See?”
</p>
<p>
    “…We’ve got to follow them. What Herald’s planning is important enough, but
    I can’t watch them risk so much. If anything were to happen to Eleanor, and
    I wasn’t there…”
</p>
<p>
    “I need no convincing. Hope you’re still alright to sail another
    expedition.”
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        “Ah. Yeah, just, give me a moment to catch my breath. Tonight’s going
        to be a <strong>long</strong> night.”
    </em>
    Abigor said. <em></em>
</p>
<p>
    They both turned to see Troy arrive, the door to his carriage automatically
    ajar. <em>“No need. Hop aboard, folks.”</em>
</p>
<p>
    Across the seas, past the reefs, a single ancient lighthouse matched up
    with the Coven’s estimations. On the lookout for the Falsus Heredis, they
    were happy to finally dock. Anything to escape the inhospitable weather.
    But the humid, roasting maze inside the landmark wasn’t too much of an
    improvement. And it seemed to prey on groups, always threatening to isolate
    someone with the confusing layout.
</p>
<p>
    “I was excited for a change of scenery. Now, I’m not so sure.” Mania
    quipped.
</p>
<p>
    “Just be proud we made it.” Eleanor pat her shoulder. “We’re so far off the
    beaten path, it’s scary. And exciting, I’ll admit. We’re more than
    explorers, now. We’re <em>discovers.”</em>
</p>
<p>
    “Come to think of it… Who else could’ve done it? Without our combined
    skills, it’s impossible. Pretty sweet, I must say, but it reminded me of
    something. Where we are now, is it the territory of <em>Odynavus?” </em>
</p>
<p>
    Artemis answered. “Can’t say for sure. Not that it matters. The madman is
    only a threat if we parked our boat in his path- and there’s a whole ocean
    out there. Why is that, Sister Diana? Pop quiz!”
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, I know!” Styx accepted an invitation for someone else. “He circles
    Remnant daily, pulling the sun around our world, his footsteps perfectly
    harmonized with every second that passes. If he stops, so does time. So,
    he’ll never let <em>anything</em> halt his stride. If our boat’s in his
    way, he’ll smash through it without missing a beat and march to the
horizon. Neither human, faunus, nor Grimm, he’s almost beyond myth. See?    <em>I</em> studied!”
</p>
<p>
    “…Thank you, Sister <em>Diana.”</em> She scolded. “Hold on. Where is she,
    anyway? Did no one keep track of her!?”
</p>
<p>
    “I thought you were doing that.”
</p>
<p>
    “Ugh! Split up and find her at once!”
</p>
<p>
    None of them realized that something <em>else</em> was searching, too.
    Diana, completely disoriented, cowered at the sound of <em>clops.</em> She
    knew what it meant. A grossly horrendous humanoid saddled upon a Grimm
    horse must’ve been nearby. “Oh no… I should’ve taken Sister Styx up on that
    stealth offer… <em>Shhh!”</em> Hoping to avoid it, she sat amongst the
    cover of stalagmites, covering her mouth, hyperventilating.
</p>
<p>
    The Eidolon must’ve savored her anxiety. It crumbled her hiding spot and
squealed in delight. Unlike any she’d ever been told of, this rider    <em>oozed</em> of seaweed, and fought with a sharp paddle. Running from
    those on horseback seemed idiotic, but now she couldn’t <em>hide,</em>
    either.
</p>
<p>
    “W-Wait! Stop! Don’t come near me!” Diana cried out. In a hysteric frenzy,
    against everything she’d been told, she rose her mask and relied on the
    unreal power inside.
</p>
<p>
    The Skeletal Dragoon impulsively blocked, collected the laser into a ball
    within its palm, and <em>reflected</em> it. Diana screamed. One flash of
    light, and she was fossilized, encased in solid material, unable to move.
    This was a rare opportunity for an Eidolon to satisfy the cravings of
    itself, and its confederates, without conflict. It raised the paddle,
    licking its lips.
</p>
<p>
    A mirror-like shield warped into reality, cutting off the Eidolon from its
    prey. Tilting its head in fear, at the sight of an Oathkeeper clad in
    bloody rags, it slowly lashed the horse away. Not long after, the stone
    keeping Diana in place faded away. She spoke once her heart stopped
    thumping.
</p>
<p>
    “Thank you, truly. You’ve saved my life. I must repay you, somehow. Who…
    Who are you?”
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <em>
            “My faunus name is Kalthus. And you must be Diana, the Coven Light.
            With an aura like that, it’s unmistakable. You are a powerful
            warrior indeed, and an unyielding force for good.”
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    “Thank you. But… I’d still like to know who you are. What are you doing
    here?”
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <em>
            “I am looking for, as you see, the other side of this Rhinestone.”
        </em>
    </strong>
    The gem floated into view.
    <strong>
        <em>
            “The Beryl Whetstone belonged to Trajan, and its connection with
            the Beryl Rhinestone was a sign of unity. Once they were separated,
            the War of the Second Bewitchment was all but confirmed. This is no
            ordinary stone, by any manner of means. It is, in fact, an ancient
            relic left by Clotho. It is not only unmistakable in appearance, it
            is undeniably pivotal to my quest. If you, or any of your sisters
            come into contact with the Beryl Whetstone, I hope you the
            foresight to alert me at once.”
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    “You have the Rhinestone? Turn around. You don’t have silver eyes, do you?”
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>“Ahahaha!”</em></strong>
    Her request revealed to her a sight of orange eyes.
    <strong>
        <em>
            “You have an extraordinary gift, Diana. It is not something to take
            lightly. I’m nowhere near that fortunate, I’m afraid.”
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Diana breathed a sigh of relief. “Sorry. I was just worried you could have
    been Xiasma… A-Actually, I’m not supposed to tell anyone outside the Coven,
    unless they’re a Descendant. Like Herald.”
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <em>
            “Hm, hm! I can certainly attest to that. Clotho would be proud to
            see her children adhere to her will in such a manner. If you may,
            will you give her my best regards?”
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    “You knew Lady Clotho?”
</p>
<p>
    The distance between the two grew as the discussion progressed.
    <strong>
        <em>
            “As it would seem. I know of her, at the very least. It has been a
            long journey since. And much more to go, I’m certain. Those are
            fables best left for another time. The Rhinestone she left has not
            yet attained full power, but it has regained much of its potential.
            The same is happening to everything that held devotion to Clotho.
            Even us.”
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    “So you <em>do</em> know her!”
</p>

            “I did. How could we not? Even after she left, we never stopped
            remembering. In regards to the gods, her presence is consistent.
            Some came and went. Yet, even after all this years, very soon,
            Clotho will feel like an old friend, who’s just been missing for a
            season.”
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    “Is that what you’re up to? Bringing her back? I know she, Lord Keres, and
    Lady Hestia have been missing for a while. Sister Artemis won’t let me know
    why, yet. It’s not fair! I <em>deserve</em> to know. What was Lady Clotho
    like?” Diana asked, eager. First-hand accounts of the gods were rare, if
    indeed real at all.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>“…Hmph. Can you keep a secret?” </em></strong>
    She nodded in excitement, leaning in to hear what she assumed would be
confidential information, best relayed in whispers.    <strong><em>“…So can I.”</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    “Sister Diana!” The rest of them called out, stumbling upon the scene. They
    saw only her. “You’re alright. Did anything happen?”
</p>
<p>
    “There was an Eidolon here, but I… I avoided it. It wasn’t easy. Pretty
    impressive, huh? I-I stopped one all by myself.” Her lie was met with
    minimal suspicion. Though it didn’t completely add up, Artemis prevented
    any scrutiny, with a signal for them to stand still.
</p>
<p>
    Her spine chilled, though it wasn’t the dim, web-ridden corridors or
    abysmal smell to thank. “I can sense it. Be careful. Down this hall, there
    is something… Unnatural. Worse than Grimm.”
</p>
<p>
    Forming a circle, they slowly treaded down the darkest chasm of caves which
    were occasionally marked by prehistoric architecture, and rows of torches
    which ignited at any approach. The end of the tunnel brought a forum.
</p>
<p>
    In the center of a stone coliseum lined with cages that held only hay, a
    seventh knight mistaken to be a <em>statue</em> kneeled. The armor held a
    sinister resemblance to that of a Keraseer. Could <em>this</em> be Aku?
    Cautiously, they all advanced, and Diana slowly lifted Tormentyst. Meeting
    air, it made an easily recognized whirling sound. The figure stood up, his
    back to the Coven.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>“Tormentyst?”</em></strong>
    The stranger identified.
    <em>
        “Have I <strong>really</strong> been indulged? On <strong>this</strong>
        night, six descendants have presented themselves to me. Let this moment
        be forever etched in history. Oh, this is beautiful. I may now indulge
        in another Corrupt Pact, at long last, and with little time to spare no
        less. Have you come to negotiate with me, or <strong>kill</strong> me?”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>“That depends.”</em>
    Artemis boomed.
    <em>
        “Are you the Captain of the Falsus Heredis? Harbinger of the Black
        Horsemen, the Eidolons? Descendant slayer who wields the Thornscourge
        blade, worshipped by none, feared by all?”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>“…That depends.”</em>
    He turned in full, his echoing voice, and fiendishly primal but uniform
    mail bringing the less willful heroes to shiver. His sword was still
    embedded in the floor.
    <em>
        “It seems I’m not feared by <strong>you.</strong> Is this truly the
        drudges of Clotho’s Coven?”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>“You do as you’re told!”</em>
    Eos stomped forward, her axe <em>almost</em> intimidation enough.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>“…I am Aku, the Trajaneer.” </em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Artemis explained.
    <em>
        “You are guilty of hubris, sedition, and deicide. For your crimes, we
        will grant a swift execution. There is no appeal.”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        “My only crime is appeasing my benevolent master. You are guilty of the
        same. But to have six Descendants here, and no Eidolons to cut them
down? It’s almost as though the Coven were <strong>made</strong> for a        <strong>Corrupt Pact,</strong> here and now.”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “W-What’s he talking about?” Diana’s voice shook. These were sinful secrets
    withheld not by <em>Clotho,</em> so Artemis was obliged to answer.
</p>
<p>
    “The <em>Corrupt Pact</em> is the only path to immortality besides the
    Forgotten Tears. It is the height of blasphemy to even <em>attempt</em>
such a thing. All it requires is knowledge, blood, four of us, and    <em>one</em> of <em>him.</em> Logic would dictate he’s already carried out
    the forbidden spell once before.”
</p>
<p>
    “He doesn’t mean to try it now, with us, does he?”
</p>
<p>
    “He won’t. He <em>can’t.”</em> Mania cracked her knuckles.
</p>
<p>
    “Let’s give him hell.” Styx sulked to the outer ring of the arena, ready to
    be forgotten.
</p>
<p>
    “He calls himself the <em>Trajaneer.” </em>Eleanor noted, still in a combat
    stance. “Who are you, really?”
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        Aku replied. “A very determined Delphic. Now, prepare yourselves.
        Remnant has not forgotten my last <strong>Corrupt Pact.</strong> But
        the clock never stopped ticking. Once again, dark forces have brought
        our kind together. The time has come for good and evil to clash once
        again, and none can say who will remain when it is done.”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Quickly, it was gathered that the usual teamwork and tactics wouldn’t work
    here, as Aku countered everything, even when flanked from every angle. His
    reputation held up. Mania’s most ferocious scythe attacks were staved off
    like an agitating breeze. Eleanor’s eloquent footwork, mixed with Eos’s
    crushing strength, did nothing but humor him.
</p>
<p>
    It wasn’t until Styx dropped in from above did he take damage for the first
    time, to her elation. “Aha! You’re just a <em>Delphic,</em> vying for power
    like the rest. You will <strong>never</strong> reawaken Trajan!”
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        “You do not know everything, coven witch. Your queen gave you an
        invaluable tool, but it’s wasted on you. I’ll be sure to harvest your
        eyes, if not as a trophy, than as a weapon more fit for battle than
        you’ll ever be.”
    </em>
    He said. Soon, all but Artemis and Diana were drained. They had a plan of
    their own, and it relied on a passive approach. With patience, they’d find
    Aku just as worn out as their allies.<em> </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Hya!”</em>
    Artemis let loose a volley of insurmountable arrows, of which Thornscourge
    was incapable of blocking in its entirety. <em>“Now!” </em>
</p>
<p>
    Not only did Diana <em>lift</em> her visor, she slipped off the entire
    helmet. All anyone could see was <em>white.</em> A light comparable to the
    sun spread forth in every direction, shattering the walls and blinding even
    those who looked away. Aku slowed to a stop, attempting to cover his eyes.
    Her scowl petrified him, turning both him, his weapon, and his armor to
    stone.
</p>
<p>
    “Quickly! Raise Tormentyst, and strike him!”
</p>
<p>
    Diana fought to even <em>lift</em> it, but with the encouragement of her
    friends, she managed to slam it down, with her target directly in the power
    arc. If only she were faster. Despite everything, the stone encasing him
    was broken in just a few seconds, and Aku stopped her pathetic swing by
    enclosing his fingers around the blade itself, giving Diana a boot to the
    stomach. They all waited curiously, even Diana, who braced herself.
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Intriguing.”</em>
    Aku uttered, watching how his hand steamed just from gripping Tormentyst.
    <em>
“The sword’s viability adjusts with its wielder. I must be        <strong>so</strong> unworthy, mere contact is a painful sin… Hahaha!
        Nobody’s going to attack? Did you expect me to <strong>use</strong> the
        sword? I’d be incinerated in an instant. No thanks.” He chucked it
        outside the ring.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “We won’t need magic for that.” A newcomer announced.
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Abigor!? What are you doing?”</em>
    Eleanor berated, while Demeter went to work on her artificial nemesis, the
    Trajaneer a sworn enemy of the Keraseers despite a lack of a personal
    history between the two pupils. “You’ve taken it too far. If I wanted you
    here, I’d have <em>asked.</em> It’s too dangerous! Leave, now.”
</p>
<p>
    “I promised you if it ever came to this, I’d be here to help. You can’t
    stop me.”
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        “Know your place! This is beyond you. It is not your fight! To bring
        not only yourself, but Troy to the dangerous frontline as well? You
        disappoint me!”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>“It’s my choice, Eleanor. Remember that.”</em>
    He moved in to great effect, stalemating where others expected complete
    failure. Eleanor had no choice but to set aside her reservations, and swoop
    in to parry a slice that would’ve gravely injured him. Together, Abigor and
    Eleanor corrected each other’s faults, knocking Aku off balance.
</p>
<p>
    She might’ve been wrong, in fact. Suddenly susceptible to attacks, he was
    decimated by everyone, from every angle. All said and done, the first
    mistake he made, he lost too much aura, and the feral assault brought him
    to his knees.
</p>
<p>
    Aku kneeled. <em>“Argh! I… I suppose it can’t be helped. Master…”</em> He
    stood up, and raised the deadly Thornscourge. The deafening chant began.
    <em>
“Odynavus! Caliph of <strong>Dusk and Dawn!</strong> Keeper of        <strong>Time and War! Lend me your power!”</strong>
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    In this heightened state, the slits of Aku’s helmet were set ablaze with
    flame, and his once immutable sword could be swung like a whip, the metal
    disobeying common sense. <em>“A weak link in the armor!”</em> He was
    attuned with some sort of improved, ethereal sight; the lapses of his
    assailants’ defenses were highlighted. None could enter his radius
    unharmed. Even his <em>form</em> was improved, the pattern of his steps
    carefully synced with attacks.
</p>
<p>
    Demeter was the only one to rebound from this terrible onslaught, believing
the cooldown of Aku’s torrent to be an opening. If only she could break his    <em>Aura,</em> victory was assured.
</p>
<p>
    He disarmed her immediately, took the Keraseer Heirloom whilst twisting
    behind her, and then shoved it through her chest from behind, ignoring
    Aura. After all, he only needed <em>four</em> alive. Aku tossed her,
Heirloom included, away like trash.    <em>“This is not the first time I’ve spilled Keraseer blood.”</em>
</p>
<p>
    “Lady Demeter! <em>No!”</em> Artemis dashed over to her body, frantic for
    any sort of response.
</p>
<p>
    Aku snapped his fingers to summon from a mythical gyre his own personal
    steed.
    <em>
        “Hahahaha. I did not wish to kill you like this. I seek only a Corrupt
        Pact, yet you six are <strong>incorruptible</strong> together.
        Remember. What I’ve done- the death toll in my name? It is only at the
        bidding of my master. I still have time before my previous pact
        expires. Our fight for <strong>that</strong> cause is not yet meant to
        take place. <strong>I will return.”</strong>
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>“You coward! I’ll kill you! I’ll torture you for an eternity!”</em>
    Artemis charged after him. Even if she <em>could</em> stop Aku’s leisure
    exit into the portal, <em>Eos</em> eliminated the possibility.
</p>
<p>
    <br/>
    <em>“He cannot be beat. Not here, not yet… Troy, stop!” </em>
</p>
<p>
    In an uncharacteristic move, perhaps out of a chance for glory, Troy
    stepped in to grapple away Thornscourge.
</p>
<p>
    “Brave of you.” Aku chirped, swatting him away without trouble.
    <em>
        “Never has a human attempted such petulance, and <strong>this</strong>
        is proof why.”
    </em>
    With his decree, he vanished.
</p>
<p>
    “Is she…?” Diana joined the rest alongside Demeter’s body
</p>
<p>
    “Dead.” Artemis almost wept. “Another prodigy, lost to that monster… This
    time, we could’ve stopped it! We’ve failed!”
</p>
<p>
    “That is not helping.” Eos used the axe to pull herself up.
</p>
<p>
    “You… You let him get away.” Artemis seethed. “And I saw what you did. You
    had a chance to stab Aku, and you held back.
    <em>
        You showed mercy to a Delphic. This is <strong>your</strong> fault!”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Sister Eos didn’t do this. Aku did.” Styx said, helping Troy off the
    ground.
</p>
<p>
    “No, she’s <strong>half</strong> correct.” Eos stopped Eleanor from also
    retorting. “I <em>did</em> hesitate on what could’ve been a critical hit.
    But you’re all too hotheaded. Your passion blinds you. Think for a moment,
    outside the fight at hand. If there was even a chance Aku had secret
    knowledge concerning the return of Trajan, it’s worth sparing him for
    questioning. After all, who else besides the so-called <em>Trajaneer</em>
    would know something we don’t?”
</p>
<p>
    “She’s right.” Abigor said. “By the gods, she’s right. I know this doctrine
    too well.”
</p>
<p>
    “Look what that amazing <em>doctrine’s</em> left us!” Mania played the
opposition, pointing at the deceased Descendant. “You spared a    <em>Delphic!</em> Did you expect us <strong>not</strong> to label you
    Xiasma after that, <em>‘Sister’</em> Eos!?” She clenched her scythe,
    furious.
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        “I think the most compelling action for a traitor <strong>now</strong>
would be to turn on their friends so quick. Wouldn’t you? Now,        <strong>back down.” </strong>
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Enough, you two!”</em>
    Artemis embraced Demeter’s prone body. “Oh, gods. I’m so, so sorry… What am
    I going to tell Sir Orthus? What about her <em>daughters?” </em>
</p>
<p>
    Eleanor consoled her, Abigor’s support preventing her own tears. The two
    hugged. “We’ll tell them <em>together.</em> And we’ll bring the body and
    armor back, for a proper funeral. Just like the last time something like
    this happened. C’mon, guys. Don’t lose hope so quick. B-Back me up, Sister
    Artemis.”
</p>
<p>
    Desperate for a sign of leadership, Eleanor was alarmed to see her oldest
    mentor simply carry Demeter away, uncaring whether or not the Coven
    followed.
