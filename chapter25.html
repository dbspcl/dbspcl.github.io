    “So, <em>this</em> is the place, huh?” Eleanor read out the many crimson
    flags lining the bridge ahead. Behind them, a massive idol of the magnate
    tempted their entry through an outstretched hand. With the smell of the
    ocean sweltering from below, and the rising sun’s grant of the clouds an
    orange hue, this empire very nearly compared to the awe of the Coven’s
    bastion. It was inspiring.
</p>
<p>
    “Admit it. You’re impressed.” Eos hauled on her back a multitude of
    weapons. Most of them were dented, cracked, or dulled.
</p>
<p>
    “I’m more surprised you lugged all that junk here. Remind me why, again?
    It’s not breakfast, is it?”
</p>
<p>
    “No… It’s missing salt.”
</p>
<p>
    “You should try that more often. Being funny, I mean. I like when you try.”
</p>
<p>
    “I’m not trying.” All that brought, along with the next order, was more
    laughing. “Stop laughing… No, <em>the truth is,</em> I brought this here as
    a peace offering. Not that it’s needed. I was told this settlement is the
    forefront of human technology and blacksmithing. I’m curious what dreadful
    killing tools they can craft out of <em>this.</em> Can a champion’s weapon
    re-forged ever swing the same again?”
</p>
<p>
“I think there’s only one man who can answer that question.    <strong><em>Gaius.</em></strong> Ambitious, for a human. That must be him,
    there.” She pointed towards the stone statue. “He’s bigger in person…
    Oh, c’mon! <em>That</em> was funny.”
</p>
<p>
    “No, but your failure certainly was.” Eleanor whacked her in the arm. “Did
    you say something?”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Allow me to clarify.”</em>
A stranger slid beside them. “This statue is of <strong>you.</strong> And <em>him.”</em> He pointed at an unidentified worker. “And that woman over <em>there!</em> The populace is what built this city, and ultimately,    <em>they</em> are the ones to be celebrated. Notice the lack of any
    definable regalia. We do not plague the lands with reminders of power,
here. The Republic will remain absolute, long after my time here is done.<em> </em>And <em>that</em> is <strong>not</strong> Gaius.    <em> But I am.”</em>
</p>
<p>
    “You?”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Welcome. Welcome to Servus City! </em>
    Just as Herald said, it was foretold that you would come. You must be…
    Artemis?”
</p>
<p>
“Sister Artemis <em>sent</em> us, rather.    <em>My name is Eleanor. I am merely an ally.” </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Eos.”
</p>
<p>
    Gaius clapped, walking further into Servus City. “Excellent, excellent- I
    was beginning to think an expert on Grimm would <em>never</em> arrive. And
    just in the nick of time, too. No doubt, the rumors brought you here. It’s
    just a shame the rest of your Coven couldn’t make it, because this may be
    more than a two person job.”
</p>
<p>
    “What are you <em>talking</em> about?” Eleanor managed to cut in, flustered
    both with his monologue and the brilliance of the surroundings.
</p>
<p>
    “Why, the Bone Graveyard, of course! Isn’t that why you’re here? Oh, Eos,
    is it? I appreciate the gesture, and I have no doubt this equipment served
    you well, but I’m afraid we’re above such barbaric weaponry here.”
</p>
<p>
    “Suit yourself.”
</p>
<p>
    “Take for example this state of the art artillery. No simple catapult,
    these cannons take advantage of our best scholars and engineers. This is
one of a kind. Through the use of gears and pistons,    <em>and some dust,</em> we can launch one of these with greater velocity
    than any weapon that’s come before.” Gaius dragged what appeared to be an
    enlarged, pointed shell of ammunition. “I’m sure it seems like witchcraft.
But believe us when we tell you, these weapons can defend better than    <em>any</em> army.”
</p>
<p>
    “This is certainly intriguing, and I appreciate the tour, but we’re in an
    urgent situation. We’re here looking for Herald-“ Eleanor began speaking.
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Yes, yes, the Bone Graveyard, that’s it.</em>
    Come quickly, I’ll bring you <em>right</em> to it. I’m just thankful you
    had the wits to answer my call before things got out of hand. You’re a
    difficult Coven to get ahold of, but you certainly know how to keep a
    minister waiting. If we work <em>together,</em> I predict we could settle
    this error, in a manner that profits us <em>both.”</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>“What are you talking about!?” </em>
</p>
<p>
    “I know, it sounds absurd, but seeing it yourself is better than any
    description that could’ve brought you here.”
</p>
<p>
    Past the vendors and gardens, he toured his guests, receiving zero
    attention from his subjects. If Gaius was in fact the ruler, one couldn’t
    tell from the way he was presented.
</p>
<p>
    Eleanor grew impatient once they stopped at the very core of Servus City.
    “So, what’s this? Why did you bring us here? To look at an oozing hole in
    the ground?”
</p>
<p>
    Gaius paused, then cleared his throat. “There was a man who lived here for
    many years, under the alias of Agramon. He served us well, but when the
    time came, he joined the rest above. My residents are the heart of this
    place, and I honored them with a burial in the center, overlooking the
    lands they loved so.”
</p>
<p>
    “You wanted to enshrine them at the highest peak.” Eleanor knew this
    tradition well. “That doesn’t explain why all the graves are down there, in
    a chasm.”
</p>
<p>
    “This <em>was</em> the apex of height. It’s been nearly a year since it
    began sinking, and now, here we are. You should’ve seen the beauty from
    this pedestal at its prime. The rising sun- the brisk winds? The way the
    skies blushed pink in the afternoons. It was <em>breathtaking.”</em>
</p>
<p>
    “Okay. What does any of this have to do with us? We’re not in the business
    of landscaping.”
</p>
<p>
    Gaius aimed his cane at the tallest tombstone, which was shrouded in a
    black haze. “I know why this is happening. Agramon sleeps at the center of
    it all, his corpse unrelenting. I don’t know how, but there’s some sort of
    cruel magic at play. He is spreading this bitter <em>infection,</em> of
    which Clotho’s Coven, though innocent, is still responsible. Don’t you
understand? The expanding Infection is <strong>Grimm.</strong>    <em>Agramon was a Delphic.”</em>
</p>
<p>
    Eos dropped her stash of armaments.
    <em>
        “Servus City harbored a Delphic? This is treason of the highest order.”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “I-I didn’t <em>know</em> he was Grimm! None of us did until his passing.
    He never left his house except for combat, and then at night? He would just
    barricade himself back inside. Like you, the man valued his privacy.”
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>“That</em></strong>
    <em> was no man.”</em>
    Eos corrected.
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Don’t you understand!?</em>
    His deception allowed a sacrifice for his city. That’s what matters. He was
to be entombed with full Servus customs! Agramon was a Delphic,    <em> yes, </em>but he was still a soldier first.”
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        “Then you are guilty for this as well! No Delphic is worth such
        dignity.”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Eleanor set a hand on Eos’ shoulder, silencing her. “I have given Delphics
    a shallow grave, before. They’ve never left any sort of influence after
    death. Do you know why this one is any different?”
</p>
<p>
    “You’re asking me? I assumed this to be a common phenomenon, for everyone
    of this species. My mistake.”
</p>
<p>
    “This is nonsense.” Eos stomped into the Bone Graveyard past them. “There’s
    only one thing <strong>to</strong> do. This <em>‘Agramon’ </em>is still
    kicking after death? Then crack open the casket and snuff out what little
    hope remains. Take notes, Gaius.<em> This</em> is how you give a dead
    Delphic its due respect.”
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        “What are you doing!? Stop! I’m ordering you! Have you lost your
        mind!?”
    </em>
    He screamed. Eleanor only watched as Eos shoved her hand into the colorless
    bog and tore the sarcophagus out from the ground with ease. It reeked. More
    surprising was the state of the Delphic inside.
</p>
<p>
    “What?” Eos let go and stumbled back.
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Impossible.” </em>
</p>
<p>
The three froze, daring each other to make the first move.    <em>“The coffin is empty.”</em>
</p>
<p>
    Artemis’ vultures circled, their caws pushing the silence back into its
    cage.
</p>
<p>
    “I can’t say I understand what’s happened here, nor how this infection was
    left in the Delphic’s wake.” Eleanor said. “There are some things even a
    Silver-Eyed Warrior has never seen, but I’ve witnessed <em>stranger</em>.
    We’re not new to such occult arts. This does confirm one thing, however.
    Somewhere, the missing body is walking free. As soon as we’re done with
    Herald, the search can begin.”
</p>
<p>
    Gaius coughed. “The <em>problem</em> is Agramon. The <em>solution</em> is
    Agramon. Go to Herald if you must. You can find him in the tallest spire,
    easily seen from here. The people thank you.”
</p>
<p>
    “We thank you as well, Gaius. Not just for this, but for revealing to us a
    Delphic still remains. I do not know how it is alive, if what you say is
    true. But I have a feeling, with its death, the Bone Graveyard will return
    to normal. Perhaps one day, after that’s done, we may return and celebrate
    this triumph.”
</p>
<p>
    “You’re going to have your hands full trying to beat him. Agramon was a
model soldier in life. One can only guess what power he’s seized in    <em>death.</em> The only fight he ever lost was the one that killed him,
    when he gave his life to stop a Geist, with his <em>silver eyes.”</em>
</p>
<p>
    Eos and Eleanor stopped to share a glance. They said nothing else, and
    departed. With every crowd, a fraction would stop to shake Eleanor’s hand,
    or bow before her. No matter where she went, the fame of the legendary
    Coven followed. Eos was in much the same position, but her less amicable
    reputation, born of myth, brought a level of esteem few dared challenge.
</p>
<p>
    “We’re looking for-” Eleanor pulled back a red curtain, nearly bumping into
    her target. <em>“…You.”</em>
</p>
<p>
    “Eleanor! Always a pleasure. And Eos, too? Lucky me. You didn’t bring an
    Eidolon with you, right? <em>Just joking.”</em> Herald saluted. As the
    conversation continued, he patrolled repetitively, dripping candle wax into
    the artificial fountain lining the velvet curtained cell. “Word on the
    street is, you and your allies are in desperate need of knowledge.
    Something about a <em>traitor</em> among the six heroes, who’ll bring back
    Trajan? Terrible.”
</p>
<p>
    “That’s exactly it. I guess we came to the right place.” Eleanor handed
    forward the texts responsible for everything. “We are not allowed to read
    any teachings from Lady Clotho above our level, but the last psychic tablet
    isn’t written by her. It’s available for anyone, but we can’t read this
    tongue. Maybe you could decipher it.”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“…Do you realize who wrote this?” </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Obviously not. We just said that.”
</p>
<p>
    “It was a figure of speech, missy. Any fool could tell this is from the
    hand of Kyradin Bael, in the language acquired before the First
Bewitchment. No wonder you <em>twits</em> can’t make any sense of it…    <em>I-I take it back!</em> You can lower your weapons…”
</p>
<p>
    They waited in anticipation for the wisdom of the Arbiter. Perhaps now,
    there’d be an answer- some sort of <em>direction. </em>Herald read in
    silence, savoring the attention. “Uhuh. <em>Okay.</em> I’ve confirmed that
    everything you’ve gathered so far is correct. The only thing this adds is a
    revelation about relics. You see, there are two of them. The first is
called <em>Black Dust,</em> but of particular note is the other: the    <strong>Beryl Rhinestone.”</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Eleanor shook her head. “Something about this doesn’t add up. Why would
    Lady Clotho ever point us towards a relic? You <em>need</em> one to summon
    Trajan. There’s no reason for her to give us the means to do so.”
</p>
<p>
    “It’s out of the question. The thought that she’d aid Trajan’s resurrection
    is unfathomable.” Eos said.
</p>
<p>
    “The same could be said of any of us. But even still, she’s guiding us
    towards a relic. What if this is what she wants?”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“That could not be what she meant… </em>
    It <strong>can’t</strong> be. It wasn’t her who wrote this anyway. It was
    Kyradin Bael.”
</p>
<p>
    “What’s the difference?”<em></em>
</p>
<p>
    Herald handed the tablets back. “All I know is, they want you to find the
    Beryl Rhinestone. And once you have, bring it here, and I’ll figure out
    what happens next. Deal?”
</p>
<p>
    Eleanor lifted her head from her hands and strutted to the balcony,
    contemplating. “What happens next…? Of course… <em>Of course!</em> Without
    the relics, Trajan can never return! They want us to <em>destroy</em>
    them!”
</p>
<p>
    “Wait.” Herald contested. “Aha- Y-You don’t wanna go and do something silly
like <em>that.</em> Don’t jump to conclusions. Just bring it here, to    <em>me,</em> and I’ll outline our next move. For Clotho, right?” A powerful
    ringing burst out, startling most but causing immediate <em>panic</em> for
    Eos and Eleanor.
</p>
<p>
    <em>“That was the dome of the Keep.”</em>
    Eos looked to the sky, witnessing a ripple in the air, originating from the
    distant east. “A lapse in the shields! Our home is <em>vulnerable</em> to
    the arms of Grimm. We’ll be needed there.”
</p>
<p>
    “What are you talking about?”
</p>
<p>
    “The barrier sealing ourselves from the world. Rarely, if ever, does it
    falter- but should it ever, our emotions are no longer masked, and anyone
    is granted entry. There’s no time to waste.” Eleanor explained.
</p>
<p>
    “You serious? What caused it in the first place?”
</p>
<p>
    “We won’t know until we’re there. One day, should we ever reunite, I’ll
    tell you. Till then. Sister Eos, do you know where the others are? Were any
    of them still there when we left?”
</p>
<p>
    “Only Sister Diana.”
</p>
<p>
    Herald quickly sat up, smirking. “Oh? I’d better come with you. Your silver
eyes and heavenly weaponry are impressive, but a master of the    <em>Old Arts</em> is still necessary.”
</p>
<p>
    “He’s right.” Gaius announced his presence. “We can’t afford to lose you.”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“You were listening in?” </em>
    Eos growled.
</p>
<p>
    “There’s no time.” Eleanor rushed outside, ignoring the murmurs of
    concerned civilians who caught sight of the horizon-wide outburst. A
    confrontation was in order. Many years had passed peacefully without any
    sign of decay in the invisible walls confining the Heart of the Coven, of
    which very little could be held accountable. Whoever had contributed to
this crisis would need to be disciplined, but all that mattered    <em>now</em> was preventing an attack. Never before had a Grimm trespassed.
    If that changed, guilt wouldn’t be the only consequence.
</p>
<p>
    “What’s going on, ladies?” Troy yawned at his post, preparing a handshake.
    They pushed him aside, gunning forward. <em>“Hey! </em>I asked you a
    question! Wait up!”
</p>
<p>
    They checked in right on time to observe the cracked security, a frenzied
Artemis bursting from the gates, barking.    <em> “Who breached the Coven’s walls? I command an answer!”</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Neither of us.”</em>
    Eos subtly stepped in front of Eleanor.
</p>
<p>
    “I can vouch for them!” Herald snapped his fingers. “We just arrived
    moments ago.”
</p>
<p>
    “Same for <em>me.”</em> Styx formed from the shadows. “I had nothing to do
    with this.”
</p>
<p>
    Artemis sighed. “…Herald. It’s been awhile. I’m sure you’ve heard of the
    terrible fate prophesized by our master. And you would understand, there is
    nothing more <em>traitorous</em> than severing the aegis keeping our home
    at peace. Are we <em>all</em> clear, here? Whoever did this has painted a
    target of astronomical proportions on their back.”
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>“Wrong.”</em></strong>
    Mania announced. With one hand on the shoulder of Diana, the truth was
    revealed. “Sister Diana and I were training her silver eyes, and,
    foolishly, I pushed her too far. She strained herself, causing a power
    surge that bounced off the barricade. I take full responsibility for this.”
</p>
<p>
    The youngest attempted to take partial blame, though Artemis wasn’t amused.
    “W-Wait. It’s not fair of you to take the fall for my mistake-“
</p>
<p>
    “Sister Diana is only to practice under <em>my</em> strict supervision.
    Someone could get hurt. <em>She</em> could get hurt. What were you
    thinking?” As the discussion continued, Herald spotted <em>Tormentyst</em>
    enshrined on the bench of Eos’ garden, placed there upon Diana’s entrance.
    Slowly, as gingerly as possible, he slithered behind everyone to claim it. He
    would’ve succeeded too, had Eleanor not strangled him back for support.
</p>
<p>
    “I already told you, we were at Servus City, with the Old Fang. Just ask
    Herald!”
</p>
<p>
    “Look.” Styx said. “We’re getting off track, here. C’mon, these two already
    admitted to doing it.”
</p>
<p>
    Artemis paced. “Even by accident, this doesn’t add up. If it doesn’t make
    sense, it can never be true. Sister Mania, we have rules! You know the
    difference between right and wrong.”
</p>
<p>
    “Sh-She did it because of me. I asked her to help me!” Diana pleaded. “I
    didn’t think there was any harm in it. I’m sorry.”
</p>
<p>
    “What are you suggesting, Sister Artemis?” Mania said. “Foul play? I’d
    never do such a thing.”
</p>
<p>
    “I’m following orders. Remember, one of us is Xiasma. Keeping Trajan out of
    Remnant matters above all else. I apologize that <em>I’m</em> the only one
    taking any of this seriously! But our council has persevered for
generations uncounted.    <em>It is through our allegiance that Remnant may rest, undying!</em>
    We’ll have to take drastic measures to preserve that law, now.”
</p>
<p>
    “We’re dealing with this as best we can. Pointing fingers isn’t going to
    help anything.” Eleanor tried to reason.
</p>
<p>
    <em>“She’s right, you know. ‘Inculto!’”</em>
    Herald commented in a high pitched tone, mocking them with his hand, still
    stuck in Eleanor’s grip.
</p>
<p>
    Artemis swallowed. “We don’t need your input, Sister Eleanor. I know it
    wasn’t you. <em>You’re</em> not the one I’m worried about.” Eleanor, at
    being approached, placed a hand on the hilt of her sword. Not necessary.
    Eos stepped in front of her, the hulking tank’s mere presence drawing away
    any attacks. <em>“How dare you.”</em>
</p>
<p>
    “Enough of this!” Eleanor shouted. “How are we this easily splintered?
    Aren’t we supposed to be a devoted family? And look at us, now. Squabbling
    like children.”
</p>
<p>
    “This is <em>exactly</em> what Trajan’s been waiting for.” Styx said. “The
    moment we lose our bond with each other, the greatest force against Grimm
    is finished.”
</p>
<p>
    “…Of course. That was foolish of me.” Artemis walked away, eyes trained on
    the others. “We’re too paranoid. We’ll settle this diplomatically, at a
    later date, once I’m in better judgment. Until then, I’ll repair the
    shield. No matter what happens, promise me we’ll have each other’s backs.”
</p>
<p>
    Hesitantly, each of them nodded.
</p>
<p>
    “In the meantime, I suggest you all get some rest. It’s not often we are
    blessed with sleep. Cherish it. Once the ritual is complete, it’ll be a
    long while before you find another chance. Perhaps… Perhaps tomorrow, under
the spell of a new moon, everything will seem better. Seem    <em>lighter.</em> Let’s just hope.”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Er, wait! Ah… Gah! No!”</em>
    Herald hissed, lightly struggling as Eleanor dragged him outside, away from
    Tormentyst. In the dead of night, she let him go.
</p>
<p>
    “A connoisseur of the Old Arts should have an easy trip back. I’ll miss
    you, Herald. It’s unfortunate <em>this</em> is how we had to reunite.”
</p>
<p>
    “…I’d agree.” He stomped away, trying to hide his anger, mumbling
    incoherently about <em>Tormentyst</em> as he kicked up piles of dirt with
    every stride.
</p>
<p>
    Eos put a hand on Eleanor’s back, and the two watched the sky under the
    guidance of constellations. In a strange twist, <em>Eos</em> spoke up
    first. “I wouldn’t hold this against Sister Artemis. A grudge is not in the
    spirit of the Coven. She cares. You can’t hold that against her.”
</p>
<p>
    “What worries me is, she was <em>right.</em> Someone in that room is
    playing us. I-It could be you. Promise me. Promise me you’re not the
    imposter.”
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t be ridiculous. Think of all the times you or I had the chance to let
    the other fall, and took the <em>right</em> path. If I’ve been planning to
    stab you in the back, I’m not a very good mastermind. I’ve missed my chance
    a hundred times over.”
</p>
<p>
    Eleanor smiled, then studied the stars. “I wish we’d never found these
    stupid tablets… Was this <em>really</em> Lady Clotho’s wish? There must be
    a happy ending to all this, right?”
</p>
<p>
    “She’s been at this far longer than us. I accept the fate she’s set before
    me. We’ve never been failed by her, <em>before.” </em>
