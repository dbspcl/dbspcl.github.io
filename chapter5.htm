<div class=WordSection1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center'><i><span style='color:#806000'>A Lorekeeper’s Tale
of Lies and Myth</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I left for
thirty seconds and this is what I get when I come back? How did you <i>do</i>
this? Are you stupid?” Zara heaved. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Simply
eccentric.” Rade corrected her. Her searing hooks were wrapped around the base
of his pitchfork, and <i>that</i> was jammed into the ground. Despite all the
pulling, Zara couldn’t dislodge it. After a grunt of discord, the scarecrow
commandeered the entire operation, grabbing the fork by the prongs. He <i>looked</i>
like the victim of a severe eating disorder, and while he was stronger than he
seemed, it was no surprise how little progress was made. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“This is <i>your</i>
pitchfork. Isn’t there some sort of switch to give a leg up?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Right you
are!” Rade likely wasn’t listening, only hearing ‘switch’ and doing as told. He
activated the compacting feature, funneling the handle into itself for easy
transportation. But since he was <i>holding</i> the pole, Rade was smacked onto
his face with a worrying <i>crunch</i> sound. Rade tiptoed over to the one
available pram and stroked his chin. “There must be another way! Why would my
weapon be so stuck in the floor? Could it be the <i>barbs?” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Why would
it be in there at all!? I really wish we had some air in here, let me just turn
on the fan and- Oh, we can’t! Your <i>bed</i> is on it!” She gestured to the
sleeping bag hanging on the ceiling fan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><b>“You</b>
put your crib outside, see? I’m pointing right at it! Contestant <b>two</b> put
theirs in <i>front</i> of the window, so you have to crawl over it every night!
As for little <i>grimster,</i> he’s the only one here who <i>has</i> a
conventional bed!” Rade smacked the mattress with angered ferocity over and
over, ruining the sheets, but his voice and mannerisms confirmed it was just
another nutty skit. The two remaining teammates loved being absent from these
affairs, tending to their own outlandish ones. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I can heat
myself up just fine, why would I mind the night sky? I don’t know why <b>she</b>
can’t do the same, she also uses fire!” Zara hinted at her partner, proving her
point by simmering flames off her hooks, invulnerable as always to the
blistering heat. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“So we’re
all crazy! Take notes from the <i>‘Flying Dutchmen’</i> in the future, he’s
more normal than anyone on this team! And that’s mighty impressive considering
he’s a <i>De-“ </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Perhaps if
Team Blazer’s two missing members were here, they could do something about the
current conflict. But somebody stronger than either broke down the door,
interrupting Rade’s rant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“The <i>Beryl
Rhinestone,</i> it must be here somehow! With its power, the research will
become clear, my calculations will be without question. <b>Rhinestone!</b> <i>That</i>
is the key to my experimentation!” This tank of a man lumbered through the doorframe,
almost catching the top of it with his hat, and began ravaging through the
cabin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Boreas?!
What’s the big idea?” Zara’s surprise was evident. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’ve lost
the Beryl Rhinestone! I had it earlier, walked in here, now it’s faded from my
possession. The thing has a mind of its own, I tell you! The Rhinestone is
hiding in here, of that I am certain. Aha!” Boreas’s voice was in a league of
its own. Hollow and raspy, but at the same time guttural and packed with clever
articulation. It matched his height and stocky build. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Ripping the
blankets off of the nearest bed revealed a perfectly spherical gem. Able to
barely fit in the palm of its seekers hand, the Beryl Rhinestone emitted an
earthy glow that matched its magenta core. When it was lifted off the bed,
Rade’s trident was launched out of the ground into the ceiling without intervention.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh! That
piece of diamond was holding my weapon down! I’d seen it earlier, but payed no
thought to it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You did!?”
Both Zara and Boreas were dumbfounded with his stupidity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yep! Little
unnerving if we’re being honest here, I couldn’t tolerate anything in this room
being more mysterious than me! Except, of course, <i>you!”</i> Rade wiggled to
Boreas’s side, noticing how his slouch made him half the brute’s size. His
textbook of horrors warped out of the wall into his hands. “So If I’m stoked by
that limestone, <i>you</i> must be terrified! Right?”  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“The
Rhinestone gains only my respect, not my fear. And for that, I <i>admire</i>
it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It actually
stabbed the pitchfork into the wood and kept it there, huh? That’s… kind of
amazing, actually. Where’d you get this thing?” Zara fixed her hair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Found in it
Summit’s Blight, believe it or not. In fact, I was planning on going there
later today. Its origins befuddle me. If my estimations are correct, there
might be more of its kind deeper down. Although I must admit, it’s more an
assumption then anything the <i>numbers</i> have told me.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“All I found
was a strange deer faunus. Sure we got lost, but as long as we stick together
we’ll make it out. We always do. Of all the times we’ve been there, we’ve never
regretted it.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“The one
time, you mean!” Rade pestered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Whatever, <i>I</i>
had fun. I’m open to going again, if you need any assistance. I bet Selene
would be on board, too.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“The rest of
<i>Team <b>Burnt</b></i> is busy with the weekend’s homework. I could always
use a helping hand from a good friend.” Boreas put the translucent rock under
his layers of leather padding. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Do you
think Team Burnt is going to be fine without their leader? It always got the
feeling you were sort of the brains of the operation.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You’re
quite receptive. Selene, however, might not be ready for a trip to back with only
<i>us</i> as her guardians. Then again, I’m only going to the <i>base</i> of
the mountains to make some measurements. It’s there that I’ll gain the answers
needed for a second trip. As long as we stay above ground, the threats within the
Blight should yield. Least, that’s what my readings have told me. We could be
in and out in mere minutes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I think
you’re underestimating Summit’s Blight.” Zara remarked. She could only assume
her adventures there were far more perilous than his. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Still, in
less than a half hour a rag-tag team lineup of Boreas, Zara, and Selene were
assembled on the edge of the gray hinges within the cliffs. Most of that time
was spent just running to the oversized formations. Rain made way for them,
although it never fully quit. At its best the air was incredibly misty, but
mostly it was at its worst. The dreary clouds cloaked everything, letting in
very little light- a great departure from the sunny Vale. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“The view is
really pretty! Even if it’s sort of… sad looking.” Selene tilted her head. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Very true
indeed. I wish I could use this machine to see the little details, but I have a
lot of work to do.” Boreas set up an apparatus somewhat resembling a telescope,
with several metal rulers slotted out of the tube. They were standing above an
overhang, nothing but limitless drops on every side. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“All work
and no play, huh?” Zara prodded. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“One of the
three of us has to stay on track, no?” He laughed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Four,
actually.” Selene held Merlin up to her nose and played a few cute games with
him. “I hope this rain lets up. This little guy can’t swim, and my dress makes
it hard to do the same! As long as we’re above ground, that’s not a problem… <i>right?”
</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“For me,
It’s not an issue at any height. The innate ability to breath underwater was
likely earned from my affinity with alchemy as it requires a vast knowledge of
the aquatic arts. All thanks to my semblance.” Boreas held the Beryl Rhinestone
up to the light alongside his appliance. It shimmered with a beauty barely
matched by the rays set upon it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Really?
Mine’s the exact opposite.” Zara wrapped her right hook around her arm and set
it ablaze, her skin somehow not scorched. “What about you, Selene?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It’s, um…”
She looked Merlin in the eyes, her face dropping. “N-Nevermind.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The same
back-tingling screech that loved shaking the land returned with more than a
vengeance. There was no doubting it was the same crazed howl they had heard the
first time. Selene racked her brain to recall the lesson that stray faunus gave
on the matter. <i>What was it called? The Grand… something?</i> With the sound,
the Beryl Rhinestone slipped out of Boreas’s fingers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“No! The
Stone!” </i>He almost jumped after it. Slowly, the purple dot disappeared into
the distant fog. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ah! You
dropped it!” Zara followed his lead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“I
didn’t! It leapt out of my hands, I swear it! <b>Blast it all!”</b></i> He
slammed his fist on the ground, fracturing the rock. Zara, having witnessed the
brilliant influence of the jewel earlier, figured he was probably right. “We
have to get it back!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Are you out
of your mind!? We can’t go down there, it’s too dangerous, we could die!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“The
Rhinestone is worth it, I assure you! We can do it, we are warriors! This
device revealed to me the depths of this crater, it’s hardly that deep!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“No, it can’t
be done. I was down to come here for sightseeing, but we can’t afford going
deeper. I was told the Summit was confusing, it abides by its own rules. You
should know that better than anyone.” Zara shook her head. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Told by
who? Trust me, there’s <i>nobody</i> who’s studied these mountains more than
me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Maybe it’s
not such a bad idea. I kind of wanted to go exploring anyway.” Selene nodded,
disregarding the warnings from her faunus friend. Boreas was already strutting
down into the depths, solidifying the journey to find the Rhinestone. Zara
sighed, rolled her eyes, and complied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Almost
immediately grimm felt it necessary to intervene, the change in elevation
already taking a toll. The Princess hid behind her current bodyguard, a ready
and waiting Zara. But without any request, Boreas stood in front of <i>her,</i>
winning the fight for dominance without issue. His immense stature triumphed
over the grimm, but his slow speed held him back. He could protect both of them
either with his bruising strikes or just by shrugging off the attacks, but it
was up to his friends to <i>let</i> him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Zara wanted
her piece of the pie, diving out of cover to kill a few stray demons herself.
Stabbing them, grappling them into each other, or stringing them into a nearby
convenient wall or pit; it didn’t matter, she was absent in the heat of battle.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Insipid
creatures!” Boreas got carried away as well, bashing creep after creep at the
cost of his aura. He had no problem enduring the abuse that came with <i>punching</i>
mobs of grimm. Lucifer, by comparison, was deliberate while also being
technical, but lacked the sheer crushing power of Boreas. Now Merlin was all
that stood between Selene and the slobbering jaws of a beowolf. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The fight
between the bunny and the beast took Selene away from her allies, separated by
a wall of stalagmites. Evidently one grimm was no match for Merlin, but now
strayed from the path, there was a new setback.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'> “Guys?
Guys!” Selene ran back to where she thought her friends were, but alas, she
found herself in a completely different room. The conundrums of the dismal
hills never left. “Ugh, why does this keep happening to me? What should we do,
Merlin?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>He swayed his
head and ears, looking up. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You’re
right! Just go exploring. That’s why we’re here, right? You can take out
anyone… <i>Me?</i> I still can’t do <i>that,</i> Merlin… I will soon, though!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>She wandered
through the open caverns, somehow in a place devoid of grimm, and took in the
sounds of the scenery. She could appreciate the charm of an overcast drizzle,
but in the back her mind lingered the fact that she <i>was</i> lost. Eventually
something unusual happened. Resting in an open crater was a single raised
segment of train tracks. One large pillar held up the disembodied platform for
what looked like a monorail. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Technology?
How could there be a train through here? Maybe I can make a call, then!” She
tried her scroll. The moment anyone set foot on Summit’s Blight, all connection
to the outside world from the <i>inside</i> had been cut. Even with signs of
machinery nearby, that didn’t change. She sighed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>There were
two options now: back the way she came, or away from the landmark onto a treacherous
path. The way forward was tough, and would require shimmying. One wrong
placement of her feet and down she’d go, but Selene’s light build set her up
well. If anyone one could make it around the cylindrical slit, it was her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The first
ten of eleven treads went well, but at the end Selene realized the tiny terrace
was unsteady just as she stepped on it. The entire path crumbled under her
weight, and she collapsed. A fall from this height was something she could not
recover from. But finally after a streak of bad luck, Selene struck gold as she
was by caught something, or rather <i>someone.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’m sorry.
I didn’t think it was a big deal.” She pouted, holding back Merlin from jumping

the Leader of Team Lance. A tactical little lad sealed in armor with

straight shot to the exit. It wouldn’t be outlandish to assume Boreas fell
through the floor because of his weight, but even if he was a lightweight
nothing would have changed. He didn’t break the ground, he sunk in.
“Quicksand!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Not

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The light

alongside her didn’t have it so good. He was still analyzing his tools. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Throw me a

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Gotcha!”

dragged a foot up, but with that, the neck holding the string gave out.
Boreas’s full weight and Zara’s complete strength was too much for what turned
out to be a loose but huge segment of boulders. The ensuing chain reaction was
almost too much to hide from. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Nomad and

even bother responding, believing the answer to be evident. Somebody else would
have interrupted him anyway. An anemic voice ricocheted off the walls, alert

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Ack! No!

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Merlin
hopped forward and growled, clearly outmatching the new threat. A bushel of
members typical for this branch of the White Fang turned the tide though, funneling
after their general. Selene saw the conflict play out, Merlin tackling enemy
after enemy to temporarily disable them and buy her time to retreat. Herald <i>may</i>
have had the agility to maneuver around and give chase, but his confidence held
him back. </p>

more men. The escape route was linear, leading right into a dark cave. Once
Selene <i>and</i> Merlin were through, a bolt ruptured the entrance, starting a
rockslide that locked her away from the White Fang. Making sure to stay out of
view up until now, Nomad dropped in from the ceiling. Selene was grateful to
have such a generous vanguard. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“I couldn’t

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Aha, it’s

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“…No it

in nature’s silence, the occasional crack outside providing shafts of divine
light. <i>“You won’t tell me about that tiara. How about that <b>girl?</b> The

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Selene <b>Virtus?”</b></i>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You don’t

would have no trouble with it!</i> She was right. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>What
happened next wasn’t considered funny in the slightest to either of the two
parties. A rocket-propelled locker fresh from Beacon Academy crashed through

approach employed when he fought <i>grimm. </i>Such a farce was occurring on
the other side of Summit’s Blight. Zara had greatly limited a wild Ursa’s

fight with a simple combo in his direction. The rest of the White Fang simply
guarded their master, but now they had to actively push his enemies back. For
Boreas, this meant six or so grunts tackling him down. He wouldn’t fall to his
knees, trying in vain to pull them off, but he did veer away from the battle ring-
away from the main conflict. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“No! Keep
her from escaping!” Herald ordered. His men closed in, having experienced Team
Lance’s justice but spared from Team Blazer’s. Zara had only a moment to think
of why these trained militants were following the commands of such a wimpy and
frankly <i>weak</i> authority. He had to be hiding something. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The two
sides figured out the strength and weaknesses of each other, exploiting them
whenever possible. The numbers advantage couldn’t be topped, Zara only able to <i>defend</i>
against the ten or so closing in. And <i>that</i> was a tall task. She was less
than delighted to see ten <i>more</i> as collateral. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Flaming
bombardments of barbed blades bounced from minion to minion, but it was a
meaningless effort. These White Fang soldiers were of the same type as before,
modified with red bandages, fighting with spikes and dust rifles alike. Zara
could only fend them off, ultimately changing courses to back off. Her nimble
style let her evade the standard infantry, but the slick <i>Herald</i> couldn’t
be outran. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Stop! Don’t
run from me!” She could hear his pleas follow her into an isolated cave. She
assumed he was all that was left, he would <i>have</i> to be if she wanted to
get out of this alive, especially when taking into account the dead end. She
was in a quarry coliseum with no way in nor out, not even from above. Deep
water surrounded the borders, leaving a small path into the middle that went
nowhere. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The aisle
had a fair few big breaks, something both parties were adequate at crossing.
Zara reached the end and turned, hooks in her hand. Herald presumable had
something up his sleeve to have given chase and directed orders at all those
troops without question. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Wait! You
can’t run!” He tiptoed to her position, paranoid at a sudden attack. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Not from
you.” She grumbled, siphoning fire into her hooks until embers drifted off of
them.  Zara had to pause though, as something well equipped and welcome intervened.
It started with a hint of bubbles, then a hulking titan rose from the swamp.
Herald was oblivious to it all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You
misunderstand! Erm, our loyalty rests with <i>my Lor- <b>Drargh!”</b></i>
Boreas stopped him, pummeling Herald in the side of the head with a baleful
fist. The White Fang commander squealed, darting into the wall. He wasn’t heavy
enough to break it, his weight serving him well in this regard, but his aura
was ruined in one hit. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“The White
Fang. What are they doing here?” Boreas cut to the chase, fencing him off from
any escape with Zara bringing up the rear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ahem, err,
we are not-” He couldn’t get to his feet on the slippery rubble. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Can it. I
bet Nadia can take him to Augustus Correctional and get some answers there.”
Zara deemed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Grrr!” Herald
paused, his reinforcements arriving at long last. Boreas and Zara made the
mistake of sizing up the new competition. Their line of site was broken with
Herald for less than a second, more than enough time for an escape. Using the
draft, he turned paper-thin, utilizing his semblance to get behind his
battalion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“How did he!?
<i>Impossible!”</i> Boreas stomped forward. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“R-Retreat! Leave
them be!” The Estranged General mounted a withdrawal. Nobody argued, villains
nor heroes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yeah, you
better run!” Zara cackled. One more hurdle cleared, hopefully their last. If
only Lucifer and Selene were as prosperous. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Wait a
minute!” Selene recognized her surroundings for once. How could she not, the <i>train
tracks</i> from earlier couldn’t be missed. They were as identical to the
classic monument as the pebble stacks were to the <i>original</i> counterparts.
It was the same location, somehow replicated far from its origin. “I was here
earlier. We’ve been going west for nearly ten minutes, how could we be running
in circles?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“There’s
something wrong with this place. Same as last time, it’s as though Summit’s
Blight was sliced into little pieces and scrambled every few minutes. I can’t
stand it.” Lucifer diagnosed. “And worst of all, Grimm everywhere.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Keep
talking like that, you’ll only attract more.” Selene felt guilty for forcing
this upon Lucifer but figured advice would never hurt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Maybe it’ll
be good practice.” On reaction a boarbatusk boomed onto the scene in an
explosion of debris, already spinning towards Lucifer. He cartwheeled away into
the range of a beowolf. A tussle of claws and fists set the wolf up to get
slammed by the boarbatusk. Predictability was a death sentence, one these young
monsters didn’t yet comprehend. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Lucifer
backed away from the fleshy shrapnel of the collision into Selene. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oops!
Sorry!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Don’t be.
Instead, stay behind me!” He pulled her into position, noticing a horde of
creeps nearby. Low health pools bnut high speeds and powerful in groups,
Lucifer grasped the sort of trouble present. Assuming he wouldn’t miss, he
counted <i>thirteen</i> shots. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The
onslaught required him to dual-wield shotguns, but even with that buffer
reloading was a strict requirement. With one creep left, he braced himself to
endure its leap and keep it off of Selene. Once the brawl was taken to the
ground, wrestling with it wouldn’t have been fun. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>It didn’t
happen. A projectile of some sort zoomed past the duo into the grimm,
puncturing it behind a rack of slabs. Lucifer turned to seek the source,
groaned, and aimed one of the guns at the rescuer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“The
blood of Atlas serves you well… Even if it does brave your intolerable pride.” </i>Nomad
had finished off the skirmish, seemingly watching the entire time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“C’mon, let
him help us!” Selene pulled on Lucifer’s cape, whispering despite experiencing
firsthand Nomad’s intense ability to eavesdrop. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You’re
lost.” Nomad stared down the barrel without blinking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Lucifer!
Remember the whole Maximus thing? You said you’d try.” She begged. He looked
down into her eyes, somehow the tables turning. He couldn’t stand that look. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Fine.
You’ll help us get out of here.” He put away the shotgun. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“On one
condition. Neither of you are to return to this place.” Nomad was already
roaming away, a silent invitation for them to watch his footsteps. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ever?”
Selene asked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Ever.”</i>
He repeated. To embolden his conviction, the now named Galathyn marked its
presence with another clamor of screaming. The holler was impossible to get
used to. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Is it
because of the White Fang? Are they too dangerous?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yes.” His
response was quick. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“How come
you’re so familiar with Summit’s Blight?” She probed, simply making small talk.
No explanation came forth. A sequence of grueling hikes in silence took them to
the bottom of a chasm. For the first time, there was nowhere to go but up. Two
steep cliffs shot straight up on either side of them, making it clear that they
were in fact settled in a misty ravine. How they got there, Lucifer was unsure,
almost dumbfounded. Nomad pulled them into a tall crevice at the sound of
dialogue further down the abyss. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What is
that? They’re not with you are they?” He snarled, seeing two mercenaries
searching ahead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“No, it’s… <i>Servus
Portum.”</i> Lucifer couldn’t believe his eyes. A pair of gunners plucked
straight from the red city had ventured inside the labyrinth, the smog still
lingering on them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Explain.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Purifiers
sent from Caligula, ruler of a rising kingdom in the north. Highly trained,
deadly efficient. He claimed the White Fang was his enemy, and that Vale has
staved off any sort of alliance with his great desire to conquer. Wait!”
Lucifer started a briefing, not yet able to fully outline the dangers ahead
before Nomad walked out to approach them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Stop
right there, faunus scum!” </i>One of the Servus Sentries targeted Nomad, who
to everyone’s surprise complied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What are
you doing here?” His tone was inquisitive, not aggressive, although as usual
his voice didn’t match his face. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“I am
here to purify these lands, for the glory of Supreme Leader Caligula.” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Nomad looked
back at Lucifer in a mixture of disbelief and bewilderment, the teenagers
hidden from view. “Whatever you’re looking for, you’ve come to the wrong place.
Tell this <i>Caligula</i> there is nothing worth seeking here. <i>He should
move on.”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Supreme
Leader Caligula acts of his own accord! As do I. Blasphemy towards a Servus
Official is punishable by <b>death!”</b> </i>They fired upon him, condemning on
the Blight’s iconic beholder a hailstorm of napalm. Nomad was <i>unconcerned,</i>
whipping the curtain of his jacket forward to shield his entire body. Somehow
it absorbed any incoming damage. This effortless display of basic defensive
skill opened up a chance for Lucifer to return fire. In the wake of a needed
reload, he pounced into the fray. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Nomad dared
not intervene, watching Lucifer trade blows with one of the gunmen. Neither
could truly deal with the other, but if the one-one-one was tipped in favor of
Servus Portum, a victor would be earned quickly. Thus Merlin meddled as per
usual, knocking the other one down and raining down a series of paw-slams. Still,
Servus Portum showcased only the best, and with a bit of perseverance the tides
were turned. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Help them!”
Selene ran up next to Nomad. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“The last
thing I need is a war with an autocrat. Should you be foolish enough to participate
in this nonsense, you’re welcome to try.”</i> He held out his crossbow. Not
once had Nomad done anything in a fight other than pull a trigger. Obviously his
aim was laudable, but even if that was all he’d shown off thus far, it was more
than Selene offered. The repeater had three bolts loaded at once, each one
having the power to instantly incapacitate most opponents. Selene missed all
three. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I-I can’t
hit them! I need your help!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“…Here.
You’re shooting too high.”</i> He crouched down, dispensed ammunition, and
guided her aim- directing her arm. He led the target for several seconds,
noticing the extra finesse that came with focusing her intent rather than his
own. “Fire.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>She did as
commanded, and with his help the arrow pierced one of the soldier’s armor and
knocked him on his back. Seeing as how he was now free, Lucifer rushed to
Merlin’s side and ceased the fight with comparative ease.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Good. But
we’ve lost time.” Nomad steered them back on track, now exploring more
traditional dens. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Time for
what? We’re not in a rush or anything. It’s not like our path changed based on
the…” Selene paused, coming to a realization. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You’ve
given me information on this new challenger, <i>Servus Portum,</i> I’ll admit.
Even if you’ve hindered me, what you’ve given makes up for it. It couldn’t hurt
to tell you my secrets, could it?” He smiled, shaking his head. <i>“You won’t
be coming back, right?” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Affirmative.”
Lucifer jumped on the idea. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Summit’s
Blight is unlike any other part of Remnant that I know of. The areas never change,
contrary to what you may have seen. But they move, reshuffle, the maze
constantly being remade anew. In a strange twist of reality, there is a
constant force making sure whatever <i>comes</i> in here <i>stays</i> in here.”
He explained. “There is, fortunately, a pattern. It all lines up with the
phases of the moon. Memorize the sequence of that shattered celestial savior,
and how it pertains to the swapping of these mountains, and you might <i>glimpse</i>
the opened way.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Okay… But
why? Why is this the way it is, why are there so many grimm here? What does the
Rhinestone have to do with it, and why are <i>you</i> here?” Selene hungered
for more knowledge. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“There is
much more to learn about Summit’s Blight. I cannot, I <b>will</b> not tell you

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We don’t
come here for fun. Last time, we were here with a purpose. I wouldn’t be
surprised to see it happen again.” Lucifer told him, bringing up the
possibility of their recurrence in the silver peaks. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“You will

It’s pure luck I showed up when I did either time.” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>With the
newfound knowledge of the maze’s behavior, Selene and Lucifer could at least
understand how Nomad was navigating, but they weren’t even close to being able
to do it on their own. His choices appeared random, and Lucifer almost swore
Nomad finally made a wrong turn when they were deadlocked at an empty grotto. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>But the
faunus couldn’t accept that, squinting at every corner. “We’re close to the
end, of that I’m certain. One right move it all it takes. Same for a wrong
move, too.” It was in fact the case that he needed Selene and Lucifer, because
with <i>them</i> came Merlin. His natural sense of direction rewarded the
group. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What is it,
little guy?” Selene followed his steps, entranced by his pawing at the wall.
One push and it collapsed in a flurry of toppling stones. <i>“Ah!”</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Maybe we
don’t need you after all.” Lucifer brushed past his guide. Nomad wasn’t too bothered
with the idea. A new hidden passage was uncovered, and not a moment too soon.
Not only were they rewarded with the exit, but their classmates. Boreas and
Zara were reunited with their friends. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Selene!
Lucifer?” The faunus with horns lit up, but the faunus with <i>Antlers</i>
disappeared, bailing on the situation as was his nature. No longer needed, and
with the threat of meeting somebody new, Nomad departed with speed so quick
nobody even saw him. The breeze was the only indication he was there at all. In
all the excitement, nobody noticed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Zara!
Finally!” Selene revered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You!”
Lucifer pointed at Boreas, trudging up to the conflicting team leader. <i>“You
brought Selene here, put us all through this, and for <b>what?</b> A <b>Rhinestone!?”
</b></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Where is
it? You’ve seen it?” Boreas cared not for the intimidation play, naturally
being taller. Lucifer pulled it out, not able to speak before it was snatched
away. “Yes! With this, we can finally leave!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We could

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It’s not a
big deal! We’re alright!” Selene ran up between the two, whispering. “What have
we been talking about? Just calm down!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ugh. Just…
don’t let it happen again. Let’s get out of here before I get more of a
headache.” His decree was met with zero contention, meaning the objective was
for once as easily done as it was said. To sweeten the cake, Team Lance’s other
half happened to be waiting at the entrance by coincidence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Nadia! We
just got back from Summit’s Blight.” Lucifer ran up with a barebones
explanation. The confusion could be seen on her face alone. “Long story short,
Selene got lost.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What
happened!? Did she get hurt? Was the White Fang there?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I don’t
know, Zara told me she fought one of their generals while we were returning,
and I suspect one of its dwellers may be among them. It sickens me to think I
may have actually received help from one of them.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Just leave
it at that, please. I don’t need to hear about how you guys took out a bunch of
partisan faunus in Summit’s Blight <i>again.” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Don’t be
silly, they got what was coming to them-“ </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Get on with
it.” Nadia rushed him along, fearing another confrontation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’ll fill
you in once I get my strength back but… I was wondering if you could help train
Selene on how to use her semblance.” Asking for help wasn’t in his nature. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh, I’d
love to, but I was about to stop by Augustus, and I’d like to do so before it
gets dark. I’m sorry.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…But you
use your semblance all the time. Who else can teach her? I just <i>really</i>
need her to be able to defend herself before something bad happens again.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’m really
sorry, but I have to go check to see if Ella has remembered anything else. You
should meet her sometime like I’ve been saying, she’s super nice-“ </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Whatever.”
Lucifer walked out on her. He cared not for Nadia’s desperate look back nor her
decision to leave regardless, believing himself unable to please. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You didn’t
have to go so hard on her.” Alecto stopped him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“She’ll
survive. What about you? Surely you can help Selene train her semblance, right?”
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Me? I
hardly use my semblance, how could I do it? Can’t you teach her?” She
testified. Questions were par for the course.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“The few
times you did, it was impressive. And I can’t quite teach a semblance, mine
doesn’t work like the sort you <i>activate.</i> As much as I hate to admit, I’m
unfamiliar with this sort of thing.” Lucifer crossed his arms. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Alright,
fine. When do you want to start? Or rather, when do you want <i>her</i> to
start? Right now?” She laid her hand on the hilt of her sword, now excited at
the thought of sparring. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You got
it.” He offered a handshake. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What is
this a deal? Would it kill you to show more affection sometime, like a hug?”
She snorted, already leaving towards the Combat Hall. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It might.” Lucifer
scorned. He, bidding farewell to Boreas and Zara, took Selene with him to the
far reaches of Beacon’s training grounds. It would be there that their practice
began, with or without Nadia. </p>
