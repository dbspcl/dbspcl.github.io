<p>
    The day introduced itself with valiant, merry, <i>agonizing</i> sunlight.
    Ella was too occupied to enjoy it. Occupied running for her life. Too busy
    sprinting through sidewalks and hiding in dumpsters. All she sought was an
    afternoon walk that would <i>hopefully</i> take her mind off Nadia’s
    absence. Now, she thought herself a <i>fool</i> for turning down Augustus’s
    offer to accompany her, because on the way back, she saw
    <b>
        Terrance.
        <p>
        </p>
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    She was rather certain he recognized her as well. <i>Everyone</i> always
    caught sight of the neon ghost who shone brighter than the best holographic
    messengers Atlas could offer, even if they <i>tried</i> to ignore her.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All this contributed to her strategy. Completely abandoning stealth, she
    thought it best to outrun him. But she wasn’t making it any closer to
    Augustus Correctional. Instead, she found herself gulled at the entrance of
    Vale’s docks.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    There weren’t too many people at this popular tourist spot. Most of them
    were wrapped within the bedsheets of their comfy homes. Terrance trespassed
    the street, walking almost as fast as she ran. Subtlety was still
    important.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “S-Stop! Terrance! Don’t come any closer!” Ella pleaded.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He sighed. “Why are you so afraid? What did <i>he</i> do to your memories?
    What did he alter within them regarding me?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“I know almost <i>nothing!</i> I hardly remember my own name! I don’t know    <i>where</i> I’ve seen you, or <i>how,</i> but there’s something inside
    telling me to stay away! I trust my instincts.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I always liked that about you. But I have to follow my heart, too. If I
    don’t take care of you, the person who did this to us will destroy
    everything we know.” Terrance inched closer, now positioned in the middle
    of the road.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Tell me what you’re going to do. Y-You better not hurt me!” She tripped
    over her words <i>and</i> her feet, knocking a cloud of dust onto the pier.
    Now, there was no chance of evading him. If only a miracle could’ve taken
    place at that very moment. If only an egotistical, insane crime-lord with
    the gall to resume his vices within Vale could have returned, with a
    <i>
        bang.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    First came the <i>tire screeches.</i> Then, Terrance pensively checked the
    source of the ear-splitting rubber, only to get a hands-on examination. A
    lavish sports vehicle of unknown origin rammed into him, destroying his
    Aura. What’s more, the driver made sure he had the speed to knock Terrance
    out of sight, into the waves below.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Now stopped, the burnt smoke of locked wheels masked the transgressor. He
    swung the door open, planted both feet onto the ground with confidence, and
    took a great sniff of the ocean breeze. Most ran at seeing him. Contently
    whistling, the man brought a glass of <i>champagne</i> to his lips. Then,
    removing his shades, he stared down Ella, daring her to speak first.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Wanna sip?”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“D-Dimitri!?</i>
    Is that you?” She crawled to her feet.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Course it’s me! It ain’t been <b>that</b> long since your grand-pappy
        sent me to Atlas! Then again, word on the street is you’ve got yourself
        a remembrance problem. Sure looked like you needed a hand back there.
        Fortunately, I got <b>plenty</b> for bird-man to catch. He didn’t take
        that hit gracefully, if you feel my drift. <b>He</b> did. So, watchu’
        been up to?”
    </i>
    Dimitri lapped up the rest of his drink, then tossed the glass back into
    his unreasonably perfect car. Certainly, it was commandeered for less than
    wholesome purposes.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “N-Nothing. You haven’t changed your ways, have you? Everyone said you were
    a terrible person, that you did terrible things.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well, let’s see. I didn’t pay that parking ticket. I killed this car and
    stole the dealer.” With fingers he began counting his feats since sunrise.
    “What I’m trying to say is, this is all just a big misunderstanding! I’m
    really not such a bad guy. Yeah, the bank teller didn’t make it through
    that heist, but the guy was already dead when I got there.”
    <i>
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-If what they say <i>is</i> true, what are you doing here? If any cops
    see you, there won’t be anywhere to hide. I’m supposed to tell Augustus if
    I see anyone suspicious. He won’t go easy on you.” She nervously held both
    hands close. There was no question Dimitri was number one most wanted for
    good reason, but he’d been consistently helping Ella, his blackmail
    notwithstanding. Because of him, Terrance was gone for the time being.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Eh. Let him try. Listen, I’ve been put on stress leave.” To her utter
    distress, he slipped close to her, and lowered his voice. “For me, this is
    a <i>business</i> venture, not a <i>holiday.</i> In Atlas, I was approached
    by a <b>woman.</b> Pretty common, but this time, it was a Grimm. Some sort
    of <i>crystal ball</i> mockery. The woman was <i>inside</i> the ball.
    There’s a floating ball, with a woman inside it, who wanted to talk.
    <i>
        Feel me?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “N-No. That sounds insane.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
Dimitri rambled quickly, half his words holding zero meaning to <i>Ella.</i> “No more questionable than myself. Said she was called    <b>Salem.</b> It was a <i>stupid</i> name. She spoke of an operation to
    target Vale, to find something called a <i>Relic.</i> Don’t know what it
    does. Don’t care. But, if <i>she</i> wants it, surely it must be worth
    something! Could be a nice <i>souvenir.</i> She should’ve kept her cards
    close to her chest, lest she learn what sort of hell someone like me can
    throw her plans into!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“I don’t understand. Who’s <i>Salem,</i> and what do you    <i>mean ‘target Vale’?</i> <i>We’re</i> in Vale!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Exactly! I’m going to swipe this Relic out from under her before she even
    realizes it’s gone. But it’ll take allies. <i>Powerful</i> allies. Allies
    who know how to dance with <i>darkness,</i> and walk away.” He ditched the
    discreet act and leapt back, spinning around with his arms outstretched. If
    there were many people around to see it, he would’ve been attracting a
    sizable crowd. “I’ve been sending invites to notable Huntsmen <i>all</i>
    over Vale- the kind you can’t find here on the streets! You wouldn’t happen
    to know of any, <i>ahem,</i> would you?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Still somewhat terrified by him, she shook her head back and forth.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Dimitri paused, then crossed his arms. “Come to think of it, with a big
    shot like Augustus as your caretaker, you might know something juicy. Does
    he know where the Relic is? And if he does, did he ever tell you? Don’t
    lie.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Ella backed away. “N-No! I promise, I don’t know anything.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Trick question!” </i>
    He jolted forward, one index finger outstretched. “I already <i>know</i>
    where the Relic is. It’s gotta be in the most well-guarded vault in Vale,
under lock and key. That means the<b>Cross Continental Transmit Tower! </b>The top, specifically.    <i>Not like it’d be at the bottom…”</i> A series of incoherent grouches
    followed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He began pacing back to his car, which had already blocked traffic, until
    something caught his eye. As one of the more renowned resting grounds
    within Vale, the docks had many attractions. One of which was a wooden
    painting of a Beowolf, with a hole cut out where its head would be.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oy! Check it! Pretty sweet portrait, <i>eh?</i> Tell you what. Snap a
    photo of me posing with it, and
    <i>
        I’ll kill you later, rather than now.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “W-Whatever you say!” Ella gasped, quickly accepting his camera and waiting
    for him to get into position. Being a quick learner, it took her only
    seconds to figure out what to do, and soon Dimitri was casually scrolling
    through his album to view the photograph. By accident, he found the picture
    of himself in this very location taken by Nadia when he first visited Vale.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s one for the books, huh? That dainty little flower, <i>Nadia,</i>
    took it. Say, where <b>is</b> she, anyway? Her unbearable heroism always
    brings a smile to my <i>gorgeous</i> face. But it won’t last. With the
    relic, I’ll have her following my every whim soon enough. The last
    apprentice wasn’t so lucky- but Nadia has promise! And when she finally
comes around, and sees Remnant as <i>I</i> see it,    <i>none will question me.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “She’s not here… She’s gone.” Ella’s frozen tear streaks darkened.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“…No.</i>
    Was it the Grimm? Bandits? She had such potential!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “N-No! She didn’t die or anything. She’s just missing somewhere in the
    mountains. I think it’s called <i>‘Terra-Something’?”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Dimitri smirked, kneeling into the driver’s seat. “Gotcha. Nadia’s gonna
    get through it, no doubt. But if she doesn’t turn up soon, I might just
    have to go to this <i>‘Terra-Something’</i> and turn whatever tide’s swept
    her up. Till next time!” The engine began revving in time with Terrance’s
    revival. From the furthest end of the harbor, he yanked himself back onto
    the slippery wooden bridge, then stumbled forward, dripping wet and
    desperately hoping Ella hadn’t noticed. She noticed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Dimitri, wait! C-Can you give me a ride back to Augustus Correctional?
    Please?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Are you drunk? I’d rather sip gasoline than go back there. Get a nurse,
    and take a walk.” He balanced his sunglasses out of his unbuttoned shirt
    onto his nose, then reconsidered his harsh treatment when Terrance entered
his vision halfway down the wharf. <i>“Hahahahahaaa…</i> Hey! Get in,    <i>Ellie.</i> Let’s take a little joyride.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “To the prison. R-Right?” She locked the door and rolled up the window upon
    entry.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If I <b>don’t</b> bring you there, I’ll have <i>‘Smokey’</i> on my back
    even outside Sanus. Just don’t count on me sticking around for the
    after-party. Too busy masterminding against the Seer to spend a couple
    weeks in the Crypt<i>.</i> <i>That’s okay with <b>you,</b> right?”</i>
    Dimitri’s speech diminished in quality until it completely collapsed into
    whooping.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Terrance coughed on the exhaust left by the criminal. Having literally been
    left in the dust, something clicked amongst a fit of bipolar rage. He
    realized that if he needed to catch a faunus, even as one himself, there
    were plenty of resources to be found to the East, past Forever Fall and
    Summit’s Blight, where <b>everything</b> was <i>red</i> and
    <i>
        perfect.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Anyone asks, it was a respectable citizen who drove you here.” Dimitri
    ordered, unlocking the passenger door and reaching over Ella to open it
    himself. The bridge to the asylum awaited.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>

    “I-I’ve never lied to Augustus, before.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s not a lie.”

    “Your problem, not mine. Don’t <i>make</i> it mine. Or I’ll come back here
    and we’re gonna have a <i>nice</i> chat.” He winked a couple too many
    times, then nudged her outside. The moment she stepped out, he rocketed
    away. Bold move considering the abundance of police. Ella crossed the
    extensive walkway towards the main gates, hoping to find Augustus inside.
    She <i>didn’t.</i> Rather, he was exposed, set up on the side of the
    overpass with a collection of digital graphs.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Are you okay?” She asked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Just checking every map in the database, and cross referencing that with
    Boreas’s notes. Before he left, he told me not to fuss in the case he
    didn’t return soon. That’s what worries me. He studied that foreign stretch
    of land and the Beryl Rhinestone excessively, and if <b>he’s</b>
    pessimistic about returning, then we’re in <i>serious</i> trouble. If only
    I could find the door to Terra Insanire, I can start to make some
    progress…”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    One of Beacon Academy’s lockers lodged itself through the flooring of the
    metal grating on which they stood, causing an obscene racket which deprived
    Augustus of his equipment. Most of it, along with Boreas’s writings, bid
    farewell into the sea. “Ah, well, that’s the end of <i>that,</i> isn’t it?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hello? Can someone open this thing?” Zara’s muffled voice, along with her
    rocking back and forth, made it clear who had dropped in. “I think it may
    have gotten damaged in the fall.” Augustus first tried force, then random
    combinations, then his sword. Its discharge of energy coils overloaded the
    locker until it burst open, releasing a welcome surprise.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Zara!?” Ella helped her up.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yep, that’s me.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Augustus spun his weapon within his two hands, reflecting sunlight into his
    glasses, which in turn glided right into Zara’s already flaming eyes. “So
    you were among those who went missing? Give me the gist of what we’re going
    up against here.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We’re not really up <i>against</i> anyone, except maybe Alecto. We just
    lost the Rhinestone, that’s all.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re saying it’s her fault? I’d dread having to cross blades with as
    cherished a friend as her.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Well…</i>
    It’s <b>partly</b> hers, and partly ours. She <i>really</i> hates Delphics,
    and-”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i> “There was a Delphic?</i>
    The <i>Administrator</i> will reward a hefty prize to you if you can bring
    him to me!” Augustus flew higher, brandishing his weapon with a
    reinvigorated excitement, lusting over the chance to finally ensnare a
    Grimm humanoid. There was an odd change in tone and behavior though, as he
    glided close and began whispering. That was, of course, after a paranoid
    episode wherein he checked to make sure no one was listening in.
    <i>
        “But… I must be honest. I have no interest in the Administrator’s goals
        of <b>capturing</b> the Delphics. I intend to <b>kill</b> them. It
        wasn’t <b>Nobody,</b> was it?”
    </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Y-Yes. It <i>was</i> Nobody.” Zara lied. She had never encountered the
    fiend herself, only hearing stories of his charm and skill. But there was a
    reason why Beleth’s Grimm nature was hidden to begin with, and she was
    willing to do what was necessary to keep her Team Leader safe.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Alecto swore she’d end his life if they ever met again. How could    <i>she</i> be responsible for this? You didn’t oppose her desire to kill a
    pitiful <i>Delphic,</i> did you?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-It’s complicated. Right now, I need to figure out how <i>Aamon</i>
    managed to get inside Terra Insanire. That means learning everything I can
    about Servus Portum. Do you know anything to help me?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…There are many repositories of information in Vale, most of it concerning
    ourselves. If I tell you where you can go, promise me that as soon as
    you’re done, you’ll take me to the door inside Terra Insanire.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Zara fought her instincts. Part of why she’d come here was to recruit
    Augustus, but after his rant pertaining to the massacre of Delphics, he was
    the <i>last</i> person she needed to join the fray. She already deceived
    him once. <i>What harm was it to lie again?</i> “Yes. I’ll bring you there
    once I learn enough.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“The most I am permitted by the Administrator to tell you is that    <i>Audrey Penelope</i> seems to have had a history with the Kingdom
    herself. Sort of <i>superfluous,</i> but I would start there.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Who is the Administrator anyway? Aren’t you the Warden? Doesn’t that mean
    you’re the head honcho around here?” Zara was already gearing up to leave,
    in search of Penelope.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He, um…” Augustus struggled to come up with something. “He just
    <i>
        administrates.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Whatever you say…” She shook her head, bemused. Following the shadow of
    Beacon Tower wasn’t even needed. Naturally, a student would know the way.
    And once there, reaching Stam’s classroom, headed by Penelope, was simple.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Finally decided to show up, huh, sweet cheeks?” Maximus laid down his
    cards, abandoning a game of solitaire. “Everyone but me and Nero have been
    forced to sit in for <i>study hall</i> ever since Team Blazer and Lance
    disappeared. Now Boreas is gone, too. Miss <i>Snooze-a-lot</i> just won’t
    take no for an answer. It’d probably do you well to check in with her. And,
    if it pleases you, feel free to tell either of us where the hell you’ve
    been.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Long story, don’t have time. Go back to licking your cards.” She waved him
    away, and aimed for the instructor’s desk. He growled, but resumed his game
    nonetheless.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “I’ll get you for that…”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Miss Penelope?” Zara threatened to wake her. “Uh,
    <i>
        Miss Penelope? Pssst!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Gah!” She fell back in her seat, her breathing heavy. “M-Miss Haken!
    You’re finally back! How long was I asleep?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Ten minutes!”</i>
    Maximus yelled.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, good. I thought it’d been days, considering you returned. Why had you
    left? I had no choice but to mark you, along with the other three-fourths
    of the class, absent for the last few sessions. Explain yourself.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Most of it isn’t important. We went training in the mountains a couple
    days ago, and got trapped. I’m only here because Boreas sacrificed himself
    to the same fate just to bring a rocket-locker. We didn’t <i>skip</i>
    class, we literally can’t leave Terra Insanire. We’re stranded.
    <i>
        Miss Penelope?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Wha… Huh! You’re stranded, yeah.” She tried to pretend as though she
    didn’t doze off mid-explanation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t mark us absent, please. We’ve been stuck in the mountains! I’ve had
    to sleep in <i>caves.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Alright, alright. As long as you’re in the wild, sparring, that counts as
    work in my book. That was always Professor <i>Stam’s</i> philosophy,
    anyway. If you’re here, where’s everyone else?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Zara recounted the events within Terra Insanire, trying not to reveal the
    brutality of Alecto nor the betrayal of Beleth. She was still convinced
    that everyone could make it out of this predicament, and didn’t want any
    outsiders to pass judgment. “The most important thing is that even with the
    Rhinestone missing, a battalion from Servus Portum made it inside! Miss
    Penelope?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “H-Huh?” Her eyes fluttered open.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Servus Portum knows how to get into Terra Insanire! Augustus said you knew
    about them.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Here, let’s walk and talk. It’ll keep me awake.” Penelope started a tour
    through Beacon’s halls, which ended in the library. But she didn’t bother
    waiting until then to begin the provision of answers. “It’s dangerous to
enter Servus Portum. I’d recommend practicing your skills against anything    <i>but</i> them. Even Grimm are more merciful, but I’m sure you know all
    about
    <i>
        that.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I do, <i>now.”</i> Zara grimaced at one of her hooks, dragging the other
    far behind.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m not familiar with Terra Insanire. Maybe I can still help, though. If
    you want to know one of my little secrets, <i>I was once a Servant.</i>
    Back then, they were just called citizens. And this would’ve probably been,
    what, <i>seventeen</i> years ago?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Which was when I was born. Sounds about right.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Haha. Yeah.” Penelope had already deduced Zara’s situation. “But when you
    say <i>they</i> found a way in there, who’s <i>they?</i> Was it Aamon?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Y-Yeah. It was. Do you know of him?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Entering the library, she helped herself to a complementary coffee machine,
    which was operated amidst her tirade. “I know him <i>personally,</i>
    actually. Or at least, I did. Portum wasn’t always the tyrannical
heavyweight you see today. It’s not like it was <i>sunflowers and rainbows</i> when I was young, but things were…    <i>different.</i> Everyone knew of life outside <i>Servus City,</i> as it
    was more commonly known. In spite of the efforts of political tyrants, we
    all knew it was paradise, relatively speaking. The only saving grace was
    Claudius, the old <i>‘Supreme Leader’</i> who truly <b>did</b> care about
    the lives of his people. The worst you’d see were labor unions, with forced
    work for little pay. But there <i>was</i> supplied housing. For a time, you
    could still get by.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Zara jeered at the sentiment. “Oh, so we weren’t quite at <i>slavery</i>
    yet. How kind.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well, <i>that</i> was a product of a <i>Caligula.</i> Textbooks don’t talk
    about <b>that,</b> not that there <i>are</i> any, and most witnesses have
different opinions about which faction was right. I was only there in the <i>beginning.</i> Servus City had just finished waging war with    <i>itself</i> due to the poor living conditions of the people, and
    considering the scapegoat of faunus, they were prepared to do it all over
    again with the
    <i>
        White Fang.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Huh. First Atlas, then Servus Portum. They’ve got a knack for ticking off
    empires.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Penelope now sat on the upper tables of the study, atop a bastille of
    books. “It wasn’t <i>really</i> the fault of the faunus, though. The
    condition of Servus City truly reached crisis point once Claudius died, and
    his son <i>Caligula</i> took the throne. That man harbored a deep hatred
    for the faunus’s protest of all-powerful government rule. To him, they were
what caused all those citizens to be lost in a revolution. And it’s    <i>because</i> of him that the enslavement of faunus
    <i>
        began.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s helpful and all, but what about <i>Aamon?</i> If we can learn as
    much about him as possible, maybe we’ll discover his techniques, and save
    those still missing.” Zara folded her arms. That part <i>wasn’t</i> a lie.
    Even if she was scouring every source possible for trivia on Servus Portum
    for her own gain, <i>that gain</i> was still secondary to her friends.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Aamon fought in the war preceding the one with the White Fang. The    <i>War of Flags,</i> it was called. What a waste of precious life. If only
    the <i>caliphs</i> and <i>ministers</i> had the sense to listen to
    Claudius.” She gulped down the sugary drink, hoping to root out as much
benefit from its delicious, sugary glory as possible. “He wasn’t a General,    <i>yet.</i> He was the lowest form of foot soldier, prepared to die for his
    country. Prior to that, he worked in the smelting mills alongside myself.
    He was rugged, and brutish. But kind. I have <b>no</b> idea what happened
    to him after that. Now, all these years later, he’s literally the highest
    ranking army of clones, with a body of steel.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “And what happened <b>you</b> once the War of Flags began?” Zara’s question
    pushed Penelope too far.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“I-I…”</i>
    She froze. Without warning, her voice became shaky. “I still can’t talk
    about it. As much as I like to defend the White Fang for their contention
against the <i>worst</i> parts of Servus City, they did…    <i>Terrible things.</i> I just want to… <i>Sleep… Sleep…”</i> Her coffee
    was depleted, and almost immediately its effects wore off. Dropping into
    her arms, Penelope’s words faltered until she was fast snoring.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Zara leaned back, digesting everything she’d heard. Two elements stood out
    to her. First was Claudius- a benevolent king who died on the twilight of a
    war which resulted in Servus Portum’s vast regiment against the faunus.
    That <i>twilight</i> was exactly as old as her, adding fuel to the fire
    within her heart.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    More and more, it seemed she <i>originated</i> from Servus Portum during
    this time of bloodshed. Last was the concept that in the face of the White
    Fang’s mistreatment, they may have deserved it. With Zara’s leave, a
    crackle of light meant to split the eastern clouds burnt her ear. Summit’s
    Blight wasn’t showing any mercy to Vale, let alone its own inhabitants.

    </i>
    Herald shuddered at the thought himself, even though he was trying to boost
    the spirits of his squad. His tail swung this way and that, a dreaded tick.

<p>
    <p>

    “What are we to do, Captain?” One Old Fang member from the crowd raised his

    <p>

    Horror overtook him as his own men, those loyal soldiers he desperately
    needed, began humming with protest until what seemed like a riot lurked.

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A proud voice of dissent pushed past every member, quickly marching towards
    Herald atop his podium.
    <i>

    He verbalized in heavily gaunt outbursts. With that, everyone became
    silent, and fanned out. No one felt like dying to get a few words in on the
    rumored wretch who swept whispers of twisted bodies and appalling tactics
    through the barracks. Not even the leader whom he defended, <i>Herald,</i>
    threatened to do anything but timidly nod when the scalding red eyes of
    Naros narrowed in on him.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    And even <i>that</i> brought trembles to his already frail physique. He
    thought it best to remove himself from Naros’ proximity, into an outpost
    where prey of Aamon suffered until they reached the front of the tent to be
    operated on. He stifled forward when a hand <i>incorrectly</i> assumed to
    be from Naros settled on his back.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Thee needn’t doubt me as thy ally, for it <i>is </i>I.”<i> </i>Theodore
    preached. “Why doth thee fear Naros so? Strange, he is, but he’s forbidden
    from harming thou, no?
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh. I-It’s just you. I can’t even begin to recount the stories revolving
    around Naros, his never ending and creative ways of tormenting who he
considers enemies. There comes a fine line between interrogation, and    <i>torture.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“But certainly, he wouldn’t dare stab thee in the back. Thee are    <b>Herald.</b> Naros <i>cannot</i> attack.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Er, I don’t understand.” Herald coughed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Theodore elaborated, his mannerisms more of a barrier than anything else.
    “If thee perishes at the hands of Naros, thine Lord will not take kindly
    his treasonous woes.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No, like, I <i>really</i> don’t understand your words. Would you mind
    talking like <i>me?”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “O-Of course. All I’m wondering, Naros can’t hurt you. For one, I doubt
    he’s got the spine for it. But beyond that, he’d be a fool to attract the
    negative eye of the Old Fang’s lord.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He doesn’t care about <i>him.</i> Ever since Beacon’s Selene was willingly
    released from the clutches of my Lord, Naros has had nothing but
    insubordination aimed at him.” Near the end of his justification, Naros
    himself swept the cloth door aside and entered the ward.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Who even <i>are</i> you? Rarely do I see you among us, <i>Doc.”</i> No
    longer slouching, he beat everyone in height. Theodore remarked how he
    lingered on certain syllables, adding a buzz to every word.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “While <i>you</i> were comfy here at home, I was entrenched on the
    battlefield, tending to the cause.” The Maddened Medic had his own fog of
    mystique to him, what with his gory uniform and unquestionable experience
    with what could only be described as a no man’s land.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Naros stayed silent, contemplating his next move. He must’ve figured
    letting the implied petulance go <i>this</i> time would save everyone
some much needed time and effort. All he did was hand Herald a letter.    <i> “I was told to give you this.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Wh-What? What’s this?” He was already gone. <i>“Hmmmm</i>. It’s an
    invitation of sorts. From somebody named Dimitri. No last name.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “May I take a look?” Theodore pulled back his mouth mask, all
    surgeries now paused. “My eyesight may be poor, but I can interpret all the
    same. So… There is a faction led by someone named <i>Salem,</i> who’s been
recruiting warriors to, among other things, find what’s called a    <i>Relic</i> in Vale. And all that was told to this <i>Dimitri</i> person
    in hopes that he would join their cause. Guess that backfired, because now
anyone who’s received letters like this has been tuned in to the plans of <i>‘Salem’.</i> Dimitri wants to get a band of people like us together to
    help him snuff out the Relic from Salem’s grasp.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Herald tried to picture the new foe <i>Salem.</i> From the sound of things,
    she wasn’t very welcoming. “I can only imagine what other fiends he’s
    turned to. If we aid him, it may be the bridge to powerful connections! And
it could be the first step to finally rid us of our association to the    <i>White</i> Fang! <i>Argh!</i> Even by our own colleagues, we are too
    often mixed in with them. But there’s a chance this could add us to the
    list for Salem, whoever she is. That would strip away the possibility of
    gliding under her radar! What <i>does</i> Dimitri propose?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He claims that he, along with anyone with the will to show up, will meet
    up on the morrow at the base of the Cross Continental Transmit Tower in
    Vale. Second floor. According to him, that’s where the Relic lies. From
    there, everyone involved will play their part to scour the structure while
    someone keeps watch outside. And once the deed is done, we scatter,
    undetected.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Behind them, a trooper with a bloody stump for an arm was thrown aside.
    Previously resting on the gurney to receive Theodore’s attention, he now
    laid sprawled out on the gravel floor. Naros was responsible. He dumped a
    body in the recruit’s place. Whoever this was, they wore straps along their
    skin, and a burlap sack had been placed over their head by the captor.
    “Naros? W-What is the meaning of this?” Herald squawked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“This man is a <b>traitor!”</b></i>
    He proclaimed, ripping the bag off the accused. This <i>traitor</i> wore a
    hood under the mess of clips and clasps, with a stone mask not unlike one
    worn by standard Old Fang members. “He was sent here to gather information
    on <i>you,</i> for Servus Portum. He needs to be punished. That’s why I
    brought <b>this.”</b> Naros slammed a communications device on the table.
    “Let’s see what kind of valuable insight we can <i>strangle</i> out of him.
    I’ll be waiting in my quarters to hear what you want me to ask him.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “O-Oh no. He’s going to torture him <i>endlessly!”</i> Herald squeaked into
    Theodore’s ear. “Y-You’d better go with him. Maybe you can keep the traitor
    hanging onto life, and if not, someone has to dispose of the body.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If you insist.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Stop! You’ve got it all wrong! I don’t work for Servus Portum!”</i>
    The masked, currently bound hireling had a clear computerized pattern to
    his voice. Perhaps it was due to the mask.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’ll cut out your <i>tongue</i> first.” Naros didn’t really care what he
    had to say, wrapping the sack back around his neck. Then, after gesturing
    for Theodore to follow him, he lugged the incriminated outsider over his
    shoulder, outside the settlement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ugh… Even as a spy, that poor thing doesn’t deserve a fate like this.”
    Herald, now alone, sat down for the first time in days. He tapped the phone
    endlessly, counting the minutes until he had to provide Naros questions.
    Overall, he was most concerned with blocking out the screams sure to
    emanate through the gadget.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For him, a surprise <i>spiced</i> things up. Finally, a good sign. He had
    no choice but to burst out of his chair, for a familiar yet nameless faunus
    with antlers crouched his way through the door. <i>“M-My Lord!”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>“Where’s my crossbow?”</i></b>
    Nomad demanded.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “R-Right there, my Lord! I kept it safe and sound <i>just</i> for you!” In
    a haze, Herald pointed wildly in the direction of a nearby desk.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You know you don’t have to keep calling me that, right?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It was the <i>Arbiter’s</i> idea. I-I don’t even know your <i>real</i>
    name.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
Nomad sat down, somehow immune to the looming moans of untreated patients.    <i>“Nomad</i> is a fine substitute, coined by <i>Selene.</i> What I’d like
    to know is how <b>this</b> ended up in your hands.” He loaded his crossbow
    in the event of a surprise attack. “You were there the night I was stabbed
    by Galathyn, weren’t you?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, my Lord.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“How did three students, newly admitted into Beacon Academy, take down the    <i>Grand Gatekeeper?</i> It’s been centuries since that beast was cursed to
    guard this land. Then a bunch of teenagers arrive, and suddenly it’s gone.
    There’s something special about <i>Lucifer, Alecto,</i> and <i>Selene.</i>
    There’s no chance three Lorekeepers were put onto the same team by pure
    luck. And among them is Zara Tir. <i>Hahaha!</i> If only she knew how
    important that name was, and still is.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well, a-actually my Lord, the <i>princess</i> has more tricks than she let
    on. I could see you were still conscious after Galathyn’s poison set in,
    still hanging on. Even if your body gave out, your mind was incorruptible.
In that time, she unlocked her <b>semblance.</b> She can control    <i>Necrocysts.”</i> Herald explained. Nomad crossed his arms and closed his
    eyes, letting the information wash over him. At a certain point, his hat
    kept Herald from determining when his eyes opened, <i>if</i> they ever did.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“…Necrocysts?</i>
    I was certain those were reserved for the gods. Can she really be so
    prolific as to hold some amount of dominion over a realm only ever
    controlled by <i>three</i> before?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“…I-I don’t know too much about those three. That would be the<i>‘Slayer of Heretics,’</i> the <i>‘Skeleton King,’ </i>and the    <i>‘Caliph of Dusk and Dawn,’ </i>right?” These titles appeared absolute
    gibberish to someone who knew not their meaning. “The Arbiter is the one
    I’d question for this. D-Didn’t they know each other personally?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nomad heaved in a deep breath, leaning back, finally showing the endless
    red optics which he saw the world through. <i>“Yes… </i>I have one last
    request for you, Herald. I ask you bake me another <i>cake.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You already used the one we made? What for?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nomad didn’t answer. And it’ll never be known if he planned to, because
    once again Naros threw himself into their affairs. This time, it was the
    speaker that shook them out of the joy of a private briefing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Herald. I’m ready to tear answers out of this rat, and I’ll cut to the
brain if I have to. I already learned his name, not that it matters.    <i>Sanzio.</i> Putrid.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Naros?” Nomad looked at Herald. “Who is Sanzio?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “A spy from Servus Portum. Naros is prepped to draw information. What do we
    want to know?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nomad kept the Nightmare Stinger waiting, then asked. Herald listened, then
    relayed the message. “Summit’s Blight is completely inhospitable. He cannot
    hope to expand his city here. Is he after the same thing we are, or does he
    think we’re the White Fang?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Separated by a mountain, Theodore listened close, then repeated the query
    to Sanzio.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m not <i>with</i> Caligula. I already told you, my dedication lies
    elsewhere.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re better served staying quiet if you’re going to lie. Your voice is
    giving me a headache. Be grateful. Most of my victims would have had their
    teeth removed by now.” Naros grabbed Sanzio by the jaw of his mask, a lemon
    ready to be crushed in his other fist. Forcing his neck back, he juiced the
    lemon over the eyes of Sanzio. His bawls didn’t deter Naros from
    alternating between that, pepper, and an old jar of homemade hot sauce.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Graaah! Stop! I’ll tell you everything!</i>
    I-I was sent here by someone who calls themselves the Administrator.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The Administrator?” Theodore echoed. “Herald? He claims to be affiliated
    with what’s called an Administrator.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b>“The</b>
    Administrator!” Sanzio corrected.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The Administrator?” Herald continued the simple yet very <i>repetitive</i>
    poem.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nomad raised a hand. “Enough. Is that someone from Servus Portum? A
    General, perhaps? Broach the subject.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
Nomad spoke through Herald, who spoke through Theodore. “Understood.    <i>So,</i> Sanzio. Who is the Administrator? A false name for a commander
    of the Servants?
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He’d kill me if I told you-”
    <i>
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’ll kill you even if you <i>do.”</i> Naros smacked him across the face.
“You’re a smart one. Every minute you stall is another I hesitate to    <i>gut</i> you.” This time, the method of wreaking agony involved
    overloading the senses through the use of a trash can full of ice water.
    Naros’ tools were simple, smothered by the budget of the Old Fang. But they
    were brutally effective in their purpose. Every chilled drop met Sanzio’s
    skin. In this sort of downpour, grounded in a freezing cave, he was already
    chattering his teeth. And there were more buckets to come.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Some five minutes of this, with encouragement from more frosty rainwater,
    and Sanzio was quickly singing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“P-P-Please! E-E-Enough!” </i>
    He begged. “Th-The Administrator wanted me to examine your forces, and
    intercept your leader to figure out if your goals aligned. B-B-But he has
    zero relation to Servus Portum. If anything, that dismal nation stands in
    the way of us both. Th-This much, I guarantee.” Theodore held the radio to
    Sanzio’s mouth this time, giving Herald a direct stream of information.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Impossible. Only <b>we’re</b> clued in the nature of Remnant.”</i>
    Nomad refuted the fundamentals of Herald’s report. “I can descend upon this
    Administrator if I knew his name. His real name.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Sounds like you aren’t too fond of combatants using fake titles.” Herald
    snickered, before regurgitating the essence of Nomad’s inquest. “What is
    the Administrator’s name?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What about it, Sanzio? We need a name.” Theodore snapped his fingers to
    ensure everyone stayed awake.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He never told me his name. He’s adamant about keeping us agents in line.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Then we’ll go from cold to <i>hot.”</i> Naros was clear in his message,
    already dousing gasoline on the martyr. Theodore tried to step in his way,
    to no avail.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We can still yank something out of him. You can’t kill him.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Watch me.”

        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Sanzio withdrew his loyalty in record time. “Uh, w-wait- I… think I’m
    starting to remember some things!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s right. Spill. Or <i>I</i> will.” Naros tipped the canister forward,
    dripping more of the oily, flammable substance on his shoulder.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He’s trying to find a <b>Relic,</b> so he can- <i>Argh!”</i> Sanzio jerked
    forward, struggling against the clasps holding him down. It appeared as
    though he was in immense pain, something giving out from within. Naros
    looked at Theodore, both either too sadistic or desensitized to show any
    emotion other than curiosity. His rabid seizure ended with his life, as
    Sanzio slumped over in his chair, the deficit of any pulse revealing him to
    be dead.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Huh. I broke him.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Was he poisoned?” Theodore began throwing out potential explanations.
    “Err… Herald? <i>Sanzio’s dead.</i> He may have had a panic attack, or
    something.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nonsense.” Nomad heard the odd snippet of context despite sitting several
    feet away from the receiver. “It’s clear. He said too much. The
    Administrator killed him.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How?” Herald said.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Sanzio is just one of many slaves controlled by the Administrator, whoever
    it is. That became clear when I picked up his words through this device.
    His motorized voice is distinct. But with his demise, whatever trail we may
    have garnered has run dry. Take care of the body.”

    “Pay your respects, if you must.” Naros spat forward and disappeared,
likely to find some other source of amusement who’d have the respect not to    <i>beg,</i> and <i>bargain</i> for their life like an annoying flea who
    didn’t know when to give in until their guts were spilt anew. He gleefully
    snickered.

    Theodore had grown numb to the pain and suffering of others, having seen a
    multitude of gnarled bodies and victims of war, many of them missing limbs
    or organs. Within a ditch, he abandoned Sanzio, allowing the mud to bury
    him while he returned to camp. The birds would provide an excellent
    funeral. But there <i>was</i> one other person who stalked onto the scene,
    prepared to whisk the remains away to a <b>proper</b> fate.

        “Tsk, tsk, tsk. I had such high hopes for you, too…”
