    <em>“I’ll save you.”</em>
    Eleanor said. <em>“I’ll save you. I’ll save you. I’ll save you.”</em>
</p>
<p>
    She didn’t save him.
</p>
<p>
    For her sanity, the simple poem helped, what with the monotony of the last
    few day’s hike. Where she was going all that time, she hadn’t the slightest
    clue- but trudging the land in circles was started to bore. Now, she stood
    the daunting gates that hid her friends, the only solace that pushed her
    here at all. She opened them just the same.
</p>
<p>
    “Eleanor!?” Mania gasped.
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, thank the gods you’ve come back!” Styx sprinted over to keep Eleanor
    from falling, her voice squeaking. “The loss of Sister Artemis was too
    much. I don’t know what we’d do without you as well! I didn’t even want to
    think about it.”
</p>
<p>
    “She’s right. As much as her conduct worried me, it’s just not the same
    without everyone. But that’s one step closer to reforming the union. The
    Coven’s existence is dependent on our alliance, and without Sister Artemis,
    none of it matters, anyway. I missed you so much.”
</p>
<p>
    “Um… Are you alright?” Styx noticed how Eleanor hardly moved, slumped back
    in her chair.
</p>
<p>
    “…I’ll save you.” She sighed.
</p>
<p>
    “…She’s scaring me, Sister Mania.”
</p>
<p>
    “Something’s happened. Tell us.”
</p>
<p>
Eleanor paused. In a trance of trauma, she could only mumble.    <em>“I killed Abigor.”</em>
</p>
<p>
    Silence followed. “What?”
</p>
<p>
    “He’s dead.”
</p>
<p>
    No matter what they tried, they couldn’t get Eleanor to elaborate.
    Eventually, after minutes of this, Mania lost her temper. “Say something!
    What took place that night? Tell us what happened, damn it!” Mania shook
    her, to no avail. <em>This must be an act,</em> she thought.
    <em>
        Eos already laid bare the crimes, and if she’s right, we’ve found our
        traitor. Eleanor won’t tell us her side? That only confirms it.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    She pulled Styx aside. “No body to speak of. I guess that means Sister Eos
    was telling the truth. I can’t think of any reason why Sister Eleanor would
    dare <em>not</em> to bring back his body, other than a Geist possession…
    He’s really gone.” She took a moment herself, the fact sinking in. “I can’t
    imagine how she must feel. Damn it all… Still, she let the Grimm go. This
    may be a cover.”
</p>
<p>
    “So what do we do?” Styx said, covering her eyes, completely overwhelmed.
</p>
<p>
    “We wait. Ugh, I <em>hate</em> waiting. Until she decides to be more
    cooperative, we’ll need a close eye on her. I’ll continue searching
    outside. Take her to Sister Diana’s room, where she can rest. Feel free to
    keep watch yourself, too.” Mania patted her on the back, then walked away.
</p>
<p>
    “O-Okay…” Styx knew, with the way Mania carried herself, this was partly an
    excuse to grieve, too. She <em>sought</em> loneliness.
</p>
<p>
    Under strict instruction, Eleanor was taken to the safer, more relaxed
    sanctum of Diana. “Eleanor!” Instantly, she nearly tackled her over, giving
    her a hug that received no reaction. “I missed you so much! Don’t ever
    leave again!”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“I have no reason to leave. I’m a failure.” </em>
</p>
<p>
    “W-What?”
</p>
<p>
    “She’s in shock.” Styx elaborated. “A-Abigor… He had to go away for a
    while. He was needed elsewhere, far beyond our scope of Remnant.”
</p>
<p>
    “Aw, I’ll miss him too, Eleanor! We all have guy troubles, sometimes. Don’t
    beat yourself up. I mean, he’ll come back, right?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes.” Styx lied. “He may be away a bit longer than we all thought,
    though.”
</p>
<p>
    “Listen, Sister Eleanor!” Diana crossed her arms and eased Eleanor onto her
    bed. “I-I know I’ve never been in a situation like this, but it’s my job to
    help you! I owe you that much. If you ever want anything, or want to do
    something, just let me know! Here, you can even have Mister Wiggles.”
</p>
<p>
    “Just give her time.” Styx offered a thumbs up, before leaving. “The front
    shrine is unguarded. I must tend to it. And… I thought it prudent to tell
    you, Sister Eos is <em>still</em> praying in the Lower Chapel. She needs
    more time. Continue to leave her alone, for your sake.”
</p>
<p>
    “I still can’t see her?” Her face dropped, not that anyone could tell under
    the visor. “H-Has she said anything, yet?”
</p>
<p>
    Styx nodded her head back and forth, then slipped out as fast as she could.
    Lying like that broke her heart, and those weren’t even <em>Mania’s</em>
    orders. Abigor’s death and the implications it carried were just too heavy
    for the youngest. For now, the dark was the safest place to be until
    everything was sorted out. At least, that was <em>Styx’s</em> way of seeing
    it. <em>“When Sister Mania finds out about this, I’m dead…” </em>
</p>
<p>
    Hours passed, with Diana periodically checking up on Eleanor. The
    occasional awkward conversation would take place, but as her mental state
    sorted itself out, she knew it would take years, if ever, to <em>fully</em>
    recover from Abigor’s death. She was at least cognoscente enough to
    comprehend Styx’s deception, and strangely enough, she agreed. Diana was
    spared all details.
</p>
<p>
    One of those dawns, Diana yawned in a sea of stuffed animals, dropping her
    books to watch Eleanor. “Hey! You doing alright?”
</p>
<p>
    She nodded. Her mind was a prison, the days rolling by as she replayed the
    Wraith’s birth over and over in her head, imagining all the ways she
    could’ve changed the outcome. If only one of these hypotheticals could be
    enacted, in a rewritten past. And after so long with only her torturous
    thoughts and the sound of Diana’s quill pen scratching forever, she finally
    sat up.
</p>
<p>
    “Sister Diana.”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes? Need more soup? You know, I think I’m finally starting to get the
    hang of this whole <em>cooking</em> thing.”
</p>
<p>
    “I’d like to leave.”
</p>
<p>
    “Y-You don’t mean you want to quit the Coven, right?”
</p>
<p>
    “No.”
</p>
<p>
    “All right!” Diana cheered, helping her off the bed. “I knew you’d come
    around, eventually. Must be pretty weird to stand after all this time, huh?
    So, what do you want to do? Even though it’s raining, it must be nice to go
    outside again. Or, we can-”
</p>
<p>
    “I wish to see Sister Eos.”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“O-Oh.</em>
    She’s in the Lower Chapel. Guess that means I’m staying here, then.” Diana
    tried to hide her disappointment. “Could you say hello for me?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes… Thank you.” After a pause, with the expectation of elaboration,
    Eleanor gave in and shut the door. True to Diana’s word, Eos was easily
    found. She was the antithesis of stealth, as per usual. In a garden of
flowers, she’d been slouched over, muttering hymns.    <em>“You know, they could still use heroes out there.” </em>
</p>
<p>
    “I suppose they could.” Eos nodded, and stood up to the beat of church
    bells. “But there’s a compromising truth. I’ve been doing a lot of
    thinking, and I’ve realized something. There was a time when you and I
    waged war out of necessity, but now it’s <em>obligation</em> that keeps us
    fighting. An oath, with no end. It’ll have to be broken, eventually.”
</p>
<p>
    “What are you saying?”
</p>
<p>
    “The world doesn’t need us anymore. We couldn’t even save <em>Abigor.</em>
    We couldn’t even <strong>kill</strong> him when he was replaced with Grimm.
    And Trajan is due to return. I can’t stop this. I can’t stop <em>you.”</em>
</p>
<p>
    The reaction was pure desperation. “I’m sorry. I couldn’t do better.
    Couldn’t <em>be</em> better. Is there anything I can do to convince you I’m
    not Xiasma? This has gone on long enough. I-I’ll disappear, and you’ll
    never see me again, if that’s what it takes. I don’t want you to have to
    question me any longer.”
</p>
<p>
    Eos shook her head. “I’ve been questioning <em>everything,</em> for as long
    as I can remember. Maybe I’ve just lost the part of me that made me human,
    strange as it may sound. That which connected me to the outside world.
    Without it, we’re just victims of a cruel scheme named existence. Maybe you
    learned that years ago.” She looked her straight in the eyes, a twinkle
    shining past the mask that impenetrably cloaked her face in shadow. “I’m
    begging you to tell me one thing. Was there <em>ever</em> a time when our
    friendship was real?”
</p>
<p>
    “I thought it was… I get it. You’ve written off everything we’ve fought
    for, since <em>this</em> is what it’s brought. A spurious mission.
    Therefore, if our companionship was a <strong>result</strong> of the
    mission, then that <em>too</em> must be fake... But I never liked you for
    the <em>Coven.</em> I liked you for <em>you.”</em> Eleanor admitted, her
    cheeks wet. They both stood next to each other, watching a glass mural
    stained with divine countenances. Somehow, though impossible, she expected
    one of them to come to life and speak. Outside, the downpour never ended.
</p>
<p>
    “I hope the afterlife isn’t a lie, too. This is the last time we’ll ever
    speak to each other <em>alive.</em> One of us is going to die, tonight.”
</p>
<p>
    “How do you figure?” Eleanor asked in monotone.
</p>
<p>
    Eos kneeled again. “This is the same feeling I had when all the Heralds
    died. I felt it the last night of Lady Demeter, <em>and</em> Abigor. I feel
    it now, with you. Despite everything, I hope it spells my death, and not
    yours.”
</p>
<p>
    “Let’s make a promise. Even if you’re the traitor-“
</p>
<p>
    “I’m not. You are.”
</p>
<p>
    “Fine. <em>Whoever it is</em>, if only one of us can make it to sunrise,
    then the other will forgive in spirit. Even through death, I want something
    of the good times to remain.” Eleanor said.
</p>
<p>
    <em>“They hid here, all this time? Among the humans?”</em> Aku held back incredulous laughter, asking Wraith a question despite
    knowing he’d receive only screeches, if any response at all. He
    precociously tested Thornscourge against the phantom fence. Brushing his
    fingers across it prompted a burning sensation. “Such impertinence for
    their bloodline is deserving of ruination enough already. Primitive beast!
    What are you waiting for? I recognized that body, and I know why you
    brought me here. Show me how well you knew the Coven, and let me inside.”
</p>
<p>
    It seemed to ignore him. “You fool! Do you believe Grimm are exempt from
    judgment?
    <em>
        It’d be a real shame to burst your bubble here and now. Of course,
        without me, you’ll never make it to <strong>Eleanor…</strong>”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>That</em>
    yielded a reaction. With little care for stealth, its spindly arms and
    distended jaw swung about, and Wraith slashed and tore at the spot of which
    Diana had damaged prior. The simple patch job done by Artemis had served
    its function well, but was not build to defend against an attack, let alone
the berserker onslaught triggered by the mention of Eleanor. They    <em>never</em> expected something to actually find them.
</p>
<p>
    “You have done well in bringing me this far.” Aku stepped inside the Heart,
    flicking now visible shreds of the glass-like wall to the ground with glee.
    Wraith nodded, slobbering about the bridge never crossed by Grimm. “Not
you. I’m talking to this <em>vermin-</em> this equally    <em>sacrilegious bile</em> of Remnant.”
</p>
<p>
    “M-Me? How <em>dare</em> you speak to me like- Ah! <em>W-Wait!”</em> Herald
    gulped at the incoming backhand. “That’s what I <em>would</em> have said,
    if you were a measly human! But the <em>Trajaneer</em> himself? Oh, it’s an
    honor, believe me.”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“I believe you.”</em>
    Aku resumed his cadence, Herald only following so close behind due to the
    drooling gaze of Wraith. In truth, neither of the three had any reason to
    let the other live beyond a common goal that wouldn’t last the hour. Still,
    it was more than the Coven could say. As Aku checked the floor curiously,
    Herald vanished. “I must admit, I’m taken aback with the golden décor. It’s
    a step above my briny, barnacle infested amphitheater beneath the sea.”
</p>
<p>
    A clash of plates, trays, and bowls caught their attention. Mania watched,
    frozen.
    <em>
        “No. No, no, no! Y-You’re just hallucinating, Mania. That’s all! Just
        seeing things, from… Stress! Yes, that must be it. It’s not real.”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, it must be awe-inspiring to see me again, <em>here</em> of all
    places. But I assure you, this is as real as it gets. You’re a sight for
    sore eyes, too.” Aku taunted. Immediately, his newest prey sprinted to the
    side in a panic, where a short but loud pipe waited for such an emergency.
    She broke it out of its prison and used it to raise the alarm. “Ah, that’s
    no fair! We want a clean, even fight. You’ll really need six, just to match
    one: myself? Oh, and these fine gentlemen as well.” He gestured to Herald,
    whom he assumed to still be quivering behind him, then Wraith. “That’ll be
    one <em>and a half. We can’t have <strong>that,</strong> can we?”</em> He
    attempted a ritual of the fingers, but Mania wouldn’t allow it.
</p>
<p>
    <em>“You are trespassing sacred ground!”</em> She forced a brawl with her Scythe, keeping Aku in a two-handed sword
    stance and preventing any summon of his crew. Meanwhile, his two present
    allies watched catatonically, either out of fear or disinterest.
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, this is beautiful.” He sighed. “I’ve not fought so boldly since my
    challenge against<em> Krey, the Soulcess’ Judge!”</em>
</p>
<p>
    “You speak nonsense!” Mania took a breather, both of them sweating in their
    metal coffins. “Did you really think you could drink the waters of the
    Soulcess’ stream unopposed? Even a human would’ve been cut down, let alone
    a sin like you.”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Anything</em>
to become immortal. In sipping from the fountain, is that not how all of    <em>you</em> managed to live this long?” A creaking door revealed Diana,
    who gasped at the sight of the two. “Oh? Well, all but <em>one.”</em>
</p>
<p>
    “Sister Diana! Get out of here, now!”
</p>
<p>
    “You’d better do as she says. <em>Take it from me!”</em> Herald announced,
    bashing his way through the doors, pretending he <em>just</em> made it here
    for the first time. Aku chuckled. “If we’re going to leave this place
together, we’ll need better equipment than I can provide. Do you have    <em>Tormentyst?” </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Y-Yes, but…” She looked back at the exhausted Mania, guilt ridden. “I
    can’t leave her like this! We’ll have to stay a little longer.”
</p>
<p>
    “What can you do? You’re a ditzy child who can barely <strong>lift</strong>
    the sword.” He scoffed. “You’re nothing! Have you any idea how many Heralds
    died at his command, and you really think you can fight <em>him?</em> You
may be <em>chosen,</em> but you’re as unworthy as they come! Go on.    <em>Break</em> yourself against Aku.” He waited, his caricature faltering.
    He couldn’t care less about Mania’s abrupt defeat, only realizing she was
    beaten at that moment.
</p>
<p>
    Standing over her, Aku held Thornscourge downward. Diana questioned his
    lack of response to her advance. If she had the experience to trust this
    intuition, she wouldn’t have been pelted away by an Eidolon. More than one,
    in fact. He was <em>surrounded</em> by his own bowlegs.
</p>
<p>
    “If… If you think my death means the end for the Coven…” Mania coughed out
    triumphantly. “You will <em>never-”</em>
</p>
<p>
    She gasped, unable to finish, his blade stabbing a hole through her pelvis.
    “I know.” He heeded, wiping the fresh stain of the blade on his arm.
</p>
<p>
    “Mania!” Diana shrieked, as Eleanor and Eos broke their way through the
    cellar doors and joined in her horror. And beside them, Styx wiped away her
own tears. <em>It may have been a mistake,</em> Aku thought,    <em>to give them such an emotional boost. </em>
</p>
<p>
    Where he offered ample time to mourn before their duel, Wraith held no
    concept of restraint. At the sight of <em>Eleanor,</em> simple pandemonium
    gave way to complex chaos. With the Black Horsemen and their Captain, a
    screeching shell of Grimm and crusader combined, and a false accomplice
    trying everything to coax the most vulnerable into handing over a sword,
    the subset of choreography and disarray was nigh indescribable.
</p>
<p>
    The bedlam ended with Styx’s defeat. Again, each member of the Falsus
    Heredis formed a dome, perfectly encircling Aku so he may advance the
    violent ceremony in peace. They hadn’t accounted for an <em>aerial</em>
    attack.
</p>
<p>
Through the roof Artemis crashed.    <em>“You could not hide your tracks forever, Delphic, and I swore you would pay for what you did!”</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Oh, wonderful!”</em>
    Aku said.
    <em>
        “The purest has arrived! I’d expected the <strong>first</strong> member
        to be the first to <strong>die,</strong> so while I’m less than
        impressed to see you join so late, it’s a pleasure all the same.
        Have at it, then!”
    </em>
    Though unexpected, this hardly changed his strategy. While they tested
    their limits in the center of the ring, each Eidolon executed their
    rehearsed routine in a robotic fashion. And all this was <em>before</em>
    the attack of Wraith. To say it was <em>frustrating</em> was an insult to
    understatements.
</p>
<p>
    “No! She needs our help!” Eleanor begged pointlessly.
</p>
<p>
    Aku was unbeatable. He’d already resisted each of them at once before,
    nights ago, and now he had help to ensure an uninterrupted duel. All the
    centuries of training, and planning, and they were <em>helpless,</em>
    humiliated to heights never thought possible.
</p>
<p>
    The resident merchant recently acquired as an ally, thankfully so, was more
    competent than he let on. True to his word, Troy was willing to deliver the
    goods. Unable to resist the chance to step inside but unsure <em>why</em>
    the shield was gone, he now had an answer.
</p>
<p>
    He attempted to stall, sending a salvo of dust forward from his shop,
    employing every trinket and dusty weapon he could. But Aku was not his
    target. In the short time he’d witnessed Abigor fight, he picked up a few
    tricks, able to predict the Wraith’s strategy based on that of his long
    deceased host. “You’re not half bad like this, but you’re still a fool to
    walk amongst this shrine. We humans need to know when to quit!”
</p>
<p>
    Eventually, he ran out of tools, his store empty. He was nothing without
that cache of equipment. Or at least, that was the impression he    <em>gave,</em> baiting Wraith to tackle him with a pathetic jog. When the
    Grimm wailed in his face, Troy closed his eyes, then smiled. “Oh, Abigor.
    You were right.” He held up a single red dust crystal, ready to ignite the
    flames. “Someone like me can never outlive you. We’ll go down together, as
    humans always do. <em>Till next time!”</em>
</p>
<p>
    In his travelers pack, a laughably unrealistic amount of dust sat, and when
    combusted, both warriors erupted apart, Wraith breaking its back upon a
    fireplace spanning several ceilings high. Troy couldn’t tell <em>what</em>
    broke his fall, only that somebody pulled him from the rubble when it was
    done crashing down.
</p>
<p>
    <em>“…Courageous.” </em>
    Aku held him up.
    <em>
        “Even for a human, you are powerful, and deserving of compassion. But
        you have no place in this fight. I shall banish you to the Land of
        Madness, where time is but a memory. You will not impede my conquest
        again.”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    He was gone, never to be seen after his departure through an unnerving
    crack in space and time. Through all this, Aku’s stamina never relented,
    one hand busy with both fending off attacks, and <em>punishing</em> those
    who sent them.
</p>
<p>
    Artemis fell to her feet, catching one last glimpse at her friends in
    action. <em>That</em> much made her happy. She worried she’d never again
    see them, but now believed, somehow, they’d press on without her. In
    death, it was definitively proven that she couldn’t be Xiasma. Whether or
    not that was her intention all along, it seemed in detail concurringly
    similar to Mania, Artemis was no more.
</p>
<p>
    Around the body, a tornado of black vultures descended before flying
    upwards, to the clouds, scattering feathers within miles of the
    thunderstruck castle. But much like Artemis herself, there was no explosive
    conclusion to their freedom.
</p>
<p>
    <em>“That’s <strong>two.”</strong></em>
    Aku breathed a sigh of relief, wiping a second streak of blood on his
    forearm. He then marched over to the still body of Styx. If they had the
    space to shut down and weep, Eos, Eleanor, and Diana would have.
</p>
<p>
    “I’ve got to stop him…” Styx choked, watching him approach her lifeless
    double. From above, she perched. Her theory <em>seemed</em> to work. He
    impaled the dummy wearing a second set of her clothes, before succumbing to
    confusion.
    <em>
        “For the sisters we lost today… I must do something… For every Grimm
        that’s ever slayed a human in cold blood… For yourself. Inculto!”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    She relied too much on silence, rather than speed. Aku had time to swoop
    around and bring an end to her cunning escapade. Sliced in the knees, she
    skid to the floor, her hood falling loose.
    <em>
        “Clever. I’d tell you never to rely on these archaic tricks, or you’ll
        lose your life. But now, that life is at an end. Still, hold honor in
        lasting this long.”
    </em>
    Pulling Styx up by the hair, he soaked in pride.<em></em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>“Stop this! Lady Clotho! Please!”</em></strong>
    Diana crumpled to the ground, trying to block out what was happening.
Styx’s demise and the next step of the corrupt pact was overtaken by    <em>Herald,</em> who scooped the fallen Tormentyst up off the ground now
    that she had at last given it up.
</p>
<p>
    “Yes!” Herald held it to the skies before taking off. It looked even better
    in his hands than he imagined, the gold reflection shining his teeth back,
    mouth agape, overjoyed. The celebration culminated with a slam, as he
    rammed into the result of an Idol’s Twilight portal and tumbled, Tormentyst
    sliding across the ground with a shrill scrape. “Ah! <em>Y-You!?”</em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>“This is unacceptable.” </em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    “Kalthus! Thank the gods you’ve come. Get me out of here! Well? What are
    you waiting for? Bring us both to the black plains before it’s too late!”
    He snatched his newest weapon back.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <em>
            “I knew you’d chase young Diana’s treasures, but to do so at the
            cost of their lives? Did you think I wanted them dead? The gods
            control everything, Herald. Even yourself. And concerning you, if
            your powers are a result of my work, then I am well within bounds
            to take them away all the same. Perhaps one day, your wandering
            ghost will forgive me. Even if you weren’t to continue on this
            path, your suffering at the hands of Keres and Clotho will exceed
            what’s already been written in store. Consider my actions tonight
            an act of mercy.”
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Herald blinked several times, shocked, on his knees. “W-Wait a minute.
    Please. I have so much more in store for Remnant. You can’t do this to me!
    I did everything you ordered, exactly as you asked! I <em>brought</em> you
    the Rhinestone<em>- <strong>Argh!”</strong></em><strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    He erupted into an array of black flames, flailing around with guttural
    cries as the broadsword was torched into his fingers, unable to let go even
    if he <em>wanted</em> to. With one last scream, not even his ashes
    remained.
</p>
<p>
    “Sir Kyradin Bael.” Eos bowed even with her wounds, sliding Tormentyst onto
    her back. “Thank you. We will forever be indebted to you, but we still need
    more aid. Is it too much to ask you save <em>us,</em> too?”
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <em>
            “Indeed. The Commander of the Old Fang’s death is favor enough. He
            had no place coming clean away with Clotho’s bequest. Always a
            pleasure.”
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
With that, Eos had no one left but Eleanor and Diana. And the latter opted <em>not</em> to sit down and whimper, but fight for their life against    <em>Wraith. </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Abigor, stop!” Eleanor said. She’d come out on top of this matchup once
    before. If only she could replicate that success, there may be half a
    chance. Eventually, through sheer will, she parried the claw attacks and
    feigned past Wraith’s tricky abilities of morphing through walls until
    checkmate was reached. She may have taken it too far.
</p>
<p>
    With one slash and throw, Wraith was nearly cut into two halves, catapulted
    against a large mantle.
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        “Why didn’t you just listen!? You’re bested, same as our last
        engagement. And the more time that passes on Remnant with you in it,
        the more powerful you’re bound to become. If I let you go a second
        time, I couldn’t live with the misery you’re sure to inflict upon
        Remnant. Forgive me!”
    </em>
    Slowly, the pillar on which Wraith was broken upon cracked, and the Heart
    of the Coven’s foundation became questionable. So drastic was this
    development that Aku and his minions stumbled about too, recognizing how
    the threat of being crushed beat any sword. But while they were concerned
    with their <em>own</em> safety, weakness was seen in the way the Coven
    looked out for<em> each other.</em>
</p>
<p>
    Eleanor pulled Diana off the ground and hugged her, resigned to act as a
    shield despite inadequate armor. In every direction the mounting walls
    crumbled, and Eleanor knew she didn’t have the strength to hold them up.
    Fortunately for them both, someone <em>else</em> did.
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Argh!”</em>
    Eos held up the unsteady Kingdom. Silence followed as she struggled to
    continue this feat.<em> “…Go! Get out of here, now!”</em>
</p>
<p>
    “Eos, no! You have to come with us!”
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        “I’m afraid that’s an impossibility. I know, now. Xiasma would never willingly sacrifice themselves as you’ve tried here… Consider this a last favor… Like
        old times!”
    </em>
In her voice, strained as it was, Eleanor could tell she was    <em>smiling. “Diana must survive… Take her far away from here.” </em>
</p>
<p>
    “But what about you!?”
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        “A promise’s a promise. I’ll be watching you from the afterlife,
        always… Thank you. You were there.”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Tormentyst in hand with Diana slung over a shoulder, Eleanor navigated the
    crumbling abbeys and painted bethels until the exit shrine was within
    sight, and the shaking stopped. With the use of Troy’s abandoned carriage
    and lonesome horses, she fled. Nothing else mattered. With one final peek
    at the ruins, she formulated a plan of hiding. One that, eventually, may
    bring retribution- but it all hinged on Diana.
</p>
<p>
    From the tallest tower, glowing in the blood of four Descendants, Aku
    watched them leave.
    <em>
        “You fought valiantly. You played your pieces well. Thank you. The
        Eidolons will slumber now, and I may finally rest. Our shared
        immortality has rendered time non-existent. Do whatever you need. Run,
        Descendants. Prepare the deepest graves. Flea for the farthest lands.
        Perhaps, if you are still alive when it is done, we may dine to the
        death another terrible night.”
    </em>
