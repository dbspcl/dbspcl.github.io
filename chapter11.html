<p>
    “The bombs hath landed far, but the sound doth echoes. Be silent, for there
    is seldom to draw thou bellows.” Theodore lied in an attempt to quench the
    moans of panic from a patient in treatment. The poor soul had taken heavy
fire in the neighboring battleground, but was fortunate enough to have lost    <i>only</i> a portion of his leg.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The bombs weren’t remote, they were very near, lingering over the ridge of
    a mountain. Theodore had heard their blasts too frequently to mistake the
    rumbles, nor claps of light in the distant glooms of clouds, for thunder.
    It was a good day, so far. The many cries of pain, not just from the
    soldier being operated on but from a few other body bags waiting their
    turn, were light this time.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    But amongst this decrepit tent that acted as a hospital, a saving grace had
    arrived, and the good doctor was in for a pleasant surprise.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “H-Hello? Oh, thanks the <i>gods</i> there’s someone here!” Herald
    slithered through the drapes.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “General! Herald, I presume? At least, the books by thou name suggest doth
    armor such an heirloom.” Theodore rambled, excited to see markings of an
    ally on Herald’s uniform.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s right… Eck! Excuse my- Gah!” He convulsed at the sight of
    Theodore’s subject. “...My weak constitution. I’m pleased to see there’s
    someone in the backlines willing to leave a helping hand. Partly because
    I’m not the only one! It’s a bloodbath out there! They won’t find us here,
    though.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“That’s why I hath chose such an alcove. In this spot, there is nigh for    <b>Servus Portum</b> to loath.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“…Right.</i>
    Can you stop talking like that?” Herald choked on the stench of death.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ahem. Pardon me. It’s a tongue few live by. But I’ve been forced to learn
    your dialect too, primitive as it is. It’s about as unfamiliar and
    dangerous as <i>Summit’s Blight,</i> and the bloodshed we’ve waged within.
    But now that you’re here, we may finally turn the tide of battle in our
    favor. What is the plan, General?” Theodore, to Herald’s disgust, removed
    his bloody gloves after their ally’s grotesque stump was sealed with
    bandages.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “My <i>plan?</i> <i>Retreat,</i> and you’d be a fool not to follow! When my
    Lord sent me here, he didn’t tell me I’d be tossed into the trenches to get
    smothered to death for <i>days</i> on end! Just <i>getting</i> here was a
    trial! I’m leaving before more of those <b>droids</b> arrive!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Theodore’s confidence plummeted at seeing his <i>commander</i> fold like
    paper. “D-Droids!? How equipped could this Servus Portum be!?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Aamon, or rather another incessant clone of him, crawled onto the scene,
    having apparently followed Herald all the way here. The bottom half of his
    engineering had been incinerated by unknown means, but that did nothing to
    stem the ensuing chaos.
    <i>
        “Firing upon a Servus Official is punishable by death! You are a
        detractor!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Gah! Kill it! <i>Kill it!”</i> Herald flipped around the teepee in a
    frenzy while a number of bedridden Fang Cadets skidded onto the floor,
    completely hysterical at the presence of a steadfast, albeit disabled
    Aamon. Through all this, Theodore scrambled to find a worthy weapon fit to
    crush the squirming automaton. A medical mallet was the smart choice, as a
    couple whacks and the head of Aamon was spread across the floor into a mess
    of electronics.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s done! Calm yourselves. So, this <i>machine</i> is what’s terrorizing
    us out on the field? I’m rather impressed we’ve lasted as long as we have
    then, all things considered.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Herald coughed, and tried to mask his fear. “As am I. But this battle is
    just the first what is likely to become a long war. The ruler of Servus
    Portum, I believe his name is <b>Caligula,</b> was hasty to send in armies
of this robot! But we have the home court advantage. Knowledge of    <b>Summit’s Blight</b> has allowed the Old Fang to resist any advance.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So, the <i>‘highly trained’ </i>brigade from up north has failed to make
    any progress in breaching the Old Fang’s defenses. Which is us.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yes! B-But, there’s a wild card! Our enemy is <b>learning.</b> From our
    observations, he isn’t making the same navigational mistakes twice! We can
hardly hold out as it is, but soon we’ll lose our only blessing!    <b>Argh!”</b>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What of our Lord? What is his command? Maybe, with some luck, he’ll arrive
    soon. He can change things for the better, right?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “O-Of course! He can do anything. As soon as he wakes up, he’ll be back,
I’m sure of it!” Herald glimpsed outside to ensure a lack of    <i>stragglers.</i> “A-And if that fails, there’s always <b>Naros</b> to
    fall back on!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Naros?</i>
    Elaborate. He’s one of us?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Aha. That, he is. But take heed, Theodore- the assassin is deadly, and
    unpredictable. I don’t even know where he <i>is,</i> truth be told. He
    wasn’t at the trenches. If I had to guess, and keep this between us, he’s
    probably on the outskirts of Summit’s Blight, picking off minions of
    Caligula and making them <i>suffer!</i> He’s evil, I tell you! Th-There’s
    an incoming Old Fang rally soon, he’ll be there for sure! If you wish to
    make his acquaintance, I suggest taking advantage of that.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “And then what?” Theodore wiped off his hammer, and began checking the
    temperature of a fallen comrade. “We’re low on troops and resources. It’ll
    take more than a <i>twisted rogue</i> to stop Servus Portum. What else have
    we got?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Herald searched for the answer. A coy smile, befitting of the Estranged
    General, signaled to Theodore that there was one last saving grace. “Well,
    we can’t dismiss the fresh friends from Beacon Academy. They evaded the
    wrath of the Fang many times, <i>and</i> brought an end to that
    monstrosity,
    <i>
        Galathyn.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You really think some students run amok from a combat school can make a
    difference?” Theodore wiped his forehead, and moved onto the next ruined
    victim that needed the miracle of medicine.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b>“Team Lance</b>
seems to have captured the attention of my Lord, and the    <i>Arbiter, Kyradin Bael.</i> I have a good feeling in regards to them,
    doctor. Problem is, they’ve been absent since our last rendezvous. For
    their sake, I hope they’re spared from this madness. But as it turns out,
    many may depend on their intervention. Could they really have wizened up
    and left Remnant’s affairs alone?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Their conversation brought theories of where the five warriors- Lucifer,
    Alecto, Nadia, Selene, and Merlin; were occupied. Neither Theodore nor
    Herald guessed right, as at this time, Beacon’s apprentices were relaxing
    amidst a recently discovered paradise.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You ever get the feeling, that there’s more out there? Something beyond
    our home to explore?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Affirmative, in the most basic sense. But Remnant is vast, Alecto. They’ll
    always be something unchecked. Another day, another bout of work from
    Huntsmen and Huntresses- lost to time. I wouldn’t worry about Remnant,
    though. Let’s focus on Sanus, first. It’s at least partially manageable.”
    Lucifer dangled his legs off the cliffs of
    <i>
        Terra Insanire.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I get it. But, staying up here, it all feels so much bigger. Look at how
    far away everything looks. I’m sure somewhere there’s something exciting,
    just waiting to be found. A new adventure! I sometimes grow tiresome of
    killing the same Grimm day after day. <i>Bo-ring!” </i>Alecto yawned,
    captivated by the view.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How about <i>this,</i> then!” Nadia, having materialized out of nowhere,
    put both her hands on Alecto’s shoulders and pretended to push her. Below
    was a drop even she could not hope to survive. Within the new flood of
    caverns and cliff sides, this area was one of Lance’s favorites. The
    Meridian, they named the spot. It was the only resting ground open to
    Remnant, high above Beacon Academy. Even Summit’s Blight, in all its
    drenching glory, could be glimpsed on the horizon.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hey! Not funny!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer chuckled at his partner’s mishaps. “I thought hunting Grimm was
    your favorite pastime. You haven’t gone soft on me, have you?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Of course not! It’s just, I-”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If so, I’d need a new punching bag.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Grr!”</i>
    Alecto tried strangling him to the tune of Nadia’s laughter, who herself
    left the rivals to their business. Away from the outlook, there remained a
    bazaar built into a nearby wall. For no matter how upraised Terra Insanire
    climbed, there was always something higher to find. Supernatural, it had
    seemed. That was among the few methods to describe how far the shady stone
    cavities sprawled.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Made a choice yet, my loyal, paying customers!?” A vendor of the shop
    asked. His assortment of random antiques and trinkets seemed appropriate
    given his maniacal clothes. Dressed for the desert, and sporting hypnotic
    eye-wear, this merchant bordered the edge between fashionable and sinister.
    “Be prepared, the Grimm have many allies! Just a couple days ago, I was
    attacked by the <i>Wraith!</i> A heinous humanoid clawed amalgamation. I
    think he might have been a friend of mine, actually. Eh, I can’t remember.
    Just be careful, the Grimm have many allies!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Um, Troy? You already said that.” Nadia looked around, fraught with
    unease.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Did I? Point is, the Grimm have many allies! In fact, I think there’s a
    couple dozen of them right down below. Just a couple days ago, I was
    attacked by the Wraith!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Selene and Merlin mirrored each other’s movements, tilting their heads in
    confusion. “I think he might be broken.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ey! You break it, you buy it! How about this, Nadia? This is a sort of
    dust not many customers have <i>ever</i> know! Maybe that’s because you’re
    the only ones I have, heh heh… A-Anyway!” Troy displayed a crystal, of
    which several sat on a shelf inside his rocky hut. “How about this, Nadia?
    This is a sort of dust few-”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Gotcha! <b>I’ve</b> seen it!”</i>
    A complete stranger barged onto the scene, holding the same type of dust
    Troy claimed was so valuable. Nadia, Selene, and Troy stared in
    bewilderment at a large specimen, cloaked from head to toe in flashy armor,
    and presenting a number of items for sale. <i>Another salesman.</i> As it
    seemed, there was more than one broker dwelling within Terra Insanire, and
    the new swindler wasn’t a stranger to the game of economics.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Who are you?” Selene instinctively hid behind Nadia.
    <p>
    </p>

<p>
    “Name’s <b>Nero-</b> greatest travelling merchant east of Sanus! And I have
    each and every commodity, ware, or weapon a warrior could indulge in! Two
    gorgeous ladies of your apparel and looks must have deep pockets. Name your
    price!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “For what?” Nadia asked. Troy sat within his booth, smirking. While Nero
    stalled with a number of overpriced dust fragments, collectables, and armor
    pieces, the duo waiting behind caught up. Lucifer stood in between them.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Name. Occupation. Allegiance.”</i>
    He was expedient in his questioning.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nero, they call me! I was just gearing up your friends for a fight- it
    seems like they could need it, no offense.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“The armor doesn’t fit. And it costs far too much lien. Try somewhere else,    <i>Nero,</i> or this so-called fight will be your downfall.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“How about this. If you can hold my flail, I’ll show you something    <i>truly</i> special.” Nero held his weapon outward. Lucifer looked back,
    sighed, and then did as told. <i>“Gotcha!” </i>Nero didn’t let go, but
    rather pulled, throwing Lucifer overhead through a boulder.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well. Who didn’t see that coming?” Troy scoffed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nero! What are you doing!?” Alecto shouted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Chill, chill! I’m not here to fight you. That was just a jest! Surely you
    can take a joke, yes? Or, if you insist on a fight, let’s make it a
    friendly one! I could always use some sparring!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Sparring? You don’t mean to tell us you’re from Beacon?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    From the entrance into the grotto, large footsteps and an eerily articulate
    voice brought good news. <b>Boreas</b> stepped onto the scene, an open book
    in his hands. “He <i>is</i> from Beacon. You <i>lads</i> never could spot
the difference between friend and foe. Nero may be a wise-cracking    <i>fool,</i> but he’s still my teammate. And if he intends to fight, it’ll
    be all in good faith, <i>I</i> can assure you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “T-Teammate? He’s on Team <b>Burnt?”</b> Alecto thought herself inept not
    to have recognized him earlier.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Selene counted each Burnt member on her fingers. “Oh, I get it! It’s
    Boreas, Nero, and Terrance! But I’m forgetting the last one.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Romulus, his first name is. You… may have ran into <i>once</i> or twice.
    Perhaps those memories are best left forgotten, though.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Huh? I’ve never met anyone by that name. What does he look like- Ah!”
    Lucifer shot past Selene, right at Nero’s throat. One gymnastic body slam
later, and Lucifer was back in perfect condition- meanwhile his    <i>target</i> was dragging himself out of hellish stone heap.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ooh! You’re pretty good, but let’s see if I can haggle you down! Just like
    in Stam’s class, eh? Come at me, for skill’s sake.” Nero raised his weapon
    so everyone could get a fine look. But soon, that decision would be
    regretted. They witnessed a fine mace with expert craftsmanship, holding
    the capacity to cause immense pain due to its jagged structure whilst the
    end contained three gnarly spiked balls, bolted to the baton with baleful
    chains. Everyone shivered.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Boreas lined up next to his partner. They stood bulky, as the tanks of
    their team, far taller than any member of Team Lance save for Lucifer.
    “You’re no match for these warriors alone, Nero. No, if you wish to
    challenge all four at once, you will need <i>my</i> assistance. Fortunately
    for you, my schedule’s clear. Have at them!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Everyone but Selene playfully clashed. The Atlesian Empress flinched as
    chunks of ore flew past, acting as a peripheral to the cataclysmic
    confrontation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Troy clapped, capturing Selene’s focus. “Ah, how nice it is to see old
    friends duking it out to better themselves, taking solace in testing each
    other’s skill! Reminds me of the time I’d helped a band of sisters pull
    through hardship amongst themselves. They were <i>champions,</i> I tell
    you! Their names were… Huh, I can’t remember. Must have been a dream.
    Anyway!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re pretty adventurous, huh? I’m always hearing about all those old
    stories. You made up some new ones last time we were here. And the time
    before <i>that.</i> Maybe someday, we can jog your memory. I’d love to hear
    the end of them.” She smiled.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, I’m sure it’ll come back to me. Reminds me of the time I’d helped a
    band of sisters pull through-”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “N-Nevermind that!” Selene struggled to keep Troy on track. “It couldn’t
    have been so long ago that you can’t remember anything. How old are you, if
    you don’t mind my asking?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “My age? Why, I’m… in my twenties? Or thirties? I think I might be in my
    hundreds, actually. Huh. I can’t remember.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hundreds? I don’t think that’s right. Ah!” Selene wasn’t prepared to dodge
    Lucifer, who swooped past her into the wall. One of Troy’s urns from the
    display shelf almost fell from the impact-induced rumble. “Are you okay?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t worry! I made sure to dodge you. Alright, Team Burnt is, rather,
    pretty good. I’ll admit it. Where’s Merlin?” He climbed out of the crater
    and stretched his neck to reunite with the loyal bunny. <i>“Damn!</i> All
    out of dust!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Here, consider this one on the house!” Troy winked and handed Lucifer a
    dust crystal. He accepted, and charged back into the fray with his pet,
    leaving a cloud behind. “Hey, wait! That costs lien!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nero’s fighting style appeared to be a modified expansion of what Boreas
offered on first glance. He soaked up any and all incoming    <i>bullets, sword strikes,</i> or <i>needle jabs</i>- it mattered little to
    him. Whatever display of displeasure was hidden, and Team Lance began to
    think Nero <i>enjoyed</i> it. Paired with the equally colossal Boreas, who
    would crush enemies with his fists rather than a brutal scourge, and Team
    Burnt was a force to be feared despite being short on members.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The skirmish was an impressive exhibition of teamwork from both sides, but
    they had limitations. This was intended to be practice, between close
    allies.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer toned down the ferocity, Alecto limited herself to defensive
    maneuvers, Nadia never took full advantage of her ambushes, Merlin opted
    only to perfect <i>paw</i> combat, and neither Boreas nor Nero felt it
    necessary to push themselves to the maximum brink of strength. The
    stalemate continued until a cursory flair of bombastic bloodshed brought
    boredom.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nice piece, Ally!” Nero snickered, grappling for the knight’s sword. “How
    much would you say it’s worth at an auction? I’d certainly like to take a
    pawn off!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “This is older than you, chump. It’s worth more than everything you’ve got
    stashed in that cloak. Forget it!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Consider it sold!” He continued wrestling with one hand, and began veering
    his flail with the other. But Lucifer caught the swinging death-pendulums,
    trying to pin his enemy down. This led to a chain reaction, wherein
    everyone piled upon the focal point: <i>Nero. </i>He could take a fair bit
    of abuse, but he couldn’t quite hold on long enough to resist falling
    through the floor and breaking his Aura. Every time, <i>that</i> proved to
    be the respected sign that the fight was over.
    <i>
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ugh.” Nero blinked a few times, waiting for Lucifer to roll off of him.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh dear! You’re okay, right?” Selene stood over the brute, waving her hand
    in front of his face.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Whew. I think that’s enough for me.” He sat up, and found he was laying on
    top of both Nadia’s gauntlet <i>and</i> Merlin, who joyfully skipped into
    Selene’s arms. “Hey, check out this view. Pretty sweet, eh?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nadia retrieved her arms. “Yep. This is where we like to wind down after
    classes, now. We call it the Meridian. You can see everything, even Beacon
    Academy.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “And our dorms, where I’d like to take a nap.” Alecto fixed her cape. “You
    two were a tough match. Hate to go up against you for real. Hate it even
    more to face my own team. Can you imagine that? Us, fighting each other
    again over something stupid?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Selene’s cheeks puffed out, as she only found comfort in Merlin’s valiant
    affection. “Don’t be ridiculous! We already agreed, nothing’ll ever come
    between us <i>again!</i> Right, Nadia?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yes. It’s going to be alright.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You don’t have to tell me, twice.” Lucifer smirked, folding his arms and
    enjoying the landscape for once.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto sat next to the youngest representative of her team, cross-legged.
    “That’s what being a team <i>is.</i> It’s trust. It’s sticking with each
    other no matter how bad things gets. And that’s what we’re going to do!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Boreas and Nero looked at each other, before smiling and giving a subtle
    nod. Burnt’s Leader spoke up. “There is a dance in a couple morrows, not to
    mention the Vytal Festival’s coming. What better time for colleagues to
    celebrate, hand in hand?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, he’s right! Too bad we’re stuck with the aftermath. That stupid    <i>Team ‘Ruby’</i> got the chance to decorate, while we’re assigned cleanup
    duty!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It matters not.” Lucifer latched his mask away, preferring for once to
    gaze upon nature without the effects of Atlesian tech. “As long as we’re
    together doing it, I wouldn’t have it any other way. Too bad none of us
    have anyone to actually <i>ask</i> to the dance.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well…” Selene giggled. “You two could always-”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Th-That’s enough!” Lucifer’s voice retained its technical but cold ring,
    and his helmet shifted back into place. Nadia laughed with everyone else,
    while Alecto hoped nobody could notice how red she’d become under her
    armor.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    There was a moment of sublime reflection, where only the chirping of birds
    and the rays of the sun threatened to interrupt the peace. Everyone watched
    Beacon in the distance, noting the flow and beauty of their home.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I <i>love</i> this place.” Selene sighed. This <b>Meridian</b> had become
    the most relaxing getaway in Vale since its discovery.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I think I can see the library from here. That reminds me. Isn’t there an
    assessment due tomorrow, assigned by Professor Penelope?” Boreas flipped
    through a textbook hidden under his leather layers. “Aha! Indeed there is.
    Perhaps now would be a good time to get started, as before long the sun
    will take its leave.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Time is money!” Nero coiled up his flail. “And we don’t want to waste
    money now, do we?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer was already ushering Selene along. “Then let us show you the way.
    This is the first time you’ve been here, so enjoy the tour. On the left,
    you’ll see <b>rocks.</b> And on the right, you’ll enjoy <b>stones.</b>
    Ahead, indulge in some
    <b>
        pebbles.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “As long as it’s free, I’m in.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The group’s banter distracted them to just how quick they were moving.
    Leading to the exit awaited a narrow cave, mined deep into the core of the
    mostly forbidden terrain. And at the very end, a postern locked them
    inside. Although carved gates weren’t usually imbued with ancient symbols,
    or a foreign force that kept them shut, this was one exception to the
    strict rule.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All were startled to hear Troy behind them, where moments prior his absence
    was absolute. “Don’t bother, it’s locked. Completely impenetrable. Not even
the gods’ might could do away with such a barrier. But, with a    <b>Beryl Rhinestone,</b> it becomes second nature.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    In the cave walls, his versant shop rebuilt itself since the last glimpse.
    Alecto coughed. “Let me just clarify. You can move your market around, and
    place it inside rocks? How are you moving around so fast to even do it?
    Don’t tell me it’s from your semblance.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Troy laughed, looking proud. “Secrets of my trade, as it would seem. These
    cliffs have many puzzles. Know where to look, and how to solve them, and
    one can do great things. Take for example this door! Don’t bother, it’s
    locked. Completely impenetrable. Not even the gods’ might could do away
    with such a barrier. But, with a <b>Beryl Rhinestone,</b> it becomes second
    nature.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“W-We know. That’s why we brought one.” Alecto held out the    <i>Rhinestone.</i> “How are you <i>this</i> familiar with Terra Insanire?
    You must’ve been studying the land for decades, considering how much you
    talk about it. Even my Kingdom Lore books don’t care to elaborate on this
    place. We found it by pure luck.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Experience yields results. Take it from me. Even though I only just set up
    shop here a couple days ago, I’ve become <i>extraordinarily</i> accustomed
    with the order of things. I’m a fast learner, you see. Travelers aren’t
very common- you’re practically all I have as returning customers. Why    <i>do</i> you and the denizens of Beacon keep snooping around here?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “There’s been an explosion of Grimm activity within Forever Fall. Thus the
    combat halls, which were already fairly occupied to begin with, have become
    crowded as of late. Honestly, it’s all thanks to you.” Lucifer hit Boreas
    in the stomach, receiving no reaction. “He found the door, and the
    Rhinestone. Least, that’s what I’ve deduced.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Boreas took the reins. “Oh, yes. A tall fellow in <i>red</i> gave it to me,
    actually. Can’t say I know who he was, disregarding my hunger for
    knowledge, but who knows. Certainly not me. Maybe he’ll show himself again,
    if we’re lucky.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ahaha! It all comes down to luck, does it not? A roll of the dice? That’s
    why I’ve got me some charms!” Troy rolled dice onto the floor, revealing
    the ornaments to be unique in purpose. Rather than dots, they held small
    engravings only the owner could decipher. “Ahuh. A bad omen. <b>Bad,</b>
    for sure! <i>Oh,</i> you better be careful out there. This does not bode
    well.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Why? What’s it mean?” Selene tilted her head curiously.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The four of you will-”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Ahem!”</i>
    Boreas cut the complimentary reading short, pointing at a golden watch he
    had swiped off Nero, who didn’t mind considering he was wearing several
    more along his arm. “Science and magic are very different. We’ll do things
    by the
    <i>
        book.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Sorry, Troy! Gotta go. See you next time!” Selene waved goodbye, and
    followed everyone back to Vale. He shook his head, smiled, and returned the
    favor. Now thoroughly separated from the sanctioned peaks, Team Lance found
    themselves above ground, back in familiar territory without a moment’s
    notice. Green shrubbery and wildlife replaced the previously abundant drear
    and heat of Terra Insanire.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Guys? That’s bad, right?” Selene pulled on Lucifer’s cape. The object of
    her concern remained a pillar of smoke rising from a scarlet forest. Its
    distance was terrible, but this anomaly suggested foul play.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Must be a village under attack.” Lucifer squinted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “A Grimm invasion!” Alecto was already running to the rescue.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>

“Stop. It’s in Forever Fall. That means it’s off limits to us    <i>‘first years.’ </i>But then again, it doesn’t look like there’s any
    chance of reinforcements considering the lack of Bullheads.”

    “Exactly! C’mon it’s our duty to help those who cannot defend themselves!
    That’s what it means to be a Keraseer. If I have to go alone, I will.”

    <p>
    </p>

    “…That’ll do it.” Lucifer sighed, pacing after her. Nadia and Selene
    automatically followed the command of their leader. The four disappeared
    into the Forever Fall forest, leaving a mess of heavy footprints.

    “If it’s consensual, it’s not a scam.” Nero explained, drifting to the
    impasse where Team Lance had recently deliberated their next move.

    “Flawless logic as always, Mister Avarice. This is why I distance myself
    from you.” Boreas checked the area. “Huh. Team Lance seems to have run off.
    Allow me the indulgence of testing your analytical skills. Did they go down
    the road clear of any activity, or the trampled path marked by five, one of
    them wearing <i>heels </i>and another walking on all<i> <b>fours,</b></i>
    towards that plume of smoke?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…” He paused, trying to play dumb.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I bet the villagers will <i>pay well</i> if we save them.” Boreas bluffed.
    Nero blasted away to aid his new consorts, leaving his boss to cackle in
    amusement.

    A perilous gorge was cut in the woods, a natural moat isolating the scarred
    town. Alecto made it to the connecting bridge first, testing the wood
    planks to make sure advance was possible. In that time, she was joined by
    Lucifer, Nadia, and Selene- not mention the final shred of ensured victory:
    Merlin. In constant fear of breaking the structurally unsound overpass,
    they tiptoed slowly. Lucifer, taking extra measures, carried Selene across
    with both hands.
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    But nearly halfway across, a sole survivor of the raided crossroads
    strolled by with uncaring strides. Upon passing, the sheen of Alecto’s
    blade caused him to stop dead in his tracks.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“That sword… You are strong.”</i>
    He laughed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer turned to see a tall warrior, lurking underneath a unique coat and
    brandishing to the side his <i>own</i> sword. He mistook the direction of
    the stranger’s words, thinking him enamored with a simple field-knife. “Is
    that supposed to be some sort of joke?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He’s not talking to <b>you.”</b> Alecto raised her brand.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Their new enemy turned to face them completely. He was shrouded in black,
    the sun shining bright from behind.
    <i>
        “Oh, color me surprised. The <b>Keraseer</b> is bright. The flames
        flaring within your heart will feel <b>so</b> satisfying to extinguish,

        the <b>only</b> one of us who practices meaningless slaughter- where

    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You would mock the <i>Soulcess!”</i> Nadia gasped. Alecto’s fury came into
    full effect.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How would he even know of it!? He’s not an Amaryllis!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer’s tolerance for this kind of child’s play was slim, and his temper
    began to crack. <i>“Silence!</i> He means only to provoke, so you may let
    your guard down and do something idiotic.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    <i>“Yes!”</i>
    The shadowy figure brushed the length of his jacket, his tone arrogant yet
    viciously calculated.
    <i>
        “I want you at ship-shape performance, motivated by <b>anger,</b> so
        our battle may be the least bit entertaining for me.”

    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What’s the big idea, huh?” Alecto’s inflection held a shaky timbre. “Do
    you have <i>any</i> idea who you’re talking to?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Indeed, I do.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Who, then?”

</p>
<p>
    <p>

<p>
    <i>

    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto’s eyes narrowed. “To <b>smear</b> the name of a <i>Keraseer,</i> and
    then an <i>Amaryllis!</i> How dare you! Move up, and reveal yourself,
    coward!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“I am Nobody, and I know enough, <b>‘Delphic Killer.’</b>”</i>
    The threat strutted forward, unveiling himself to be one of the Grimm
    conquerors Alecto detested so. Unbeknownst to Beacon’s heroes, this was the
    same swordsman the dreaded <i>Dimitri</i> had encountered earlier in their
    semester.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer let out an uncharacteristic stutter.
    <i>
        “H-He’s a Delphic?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto didn’t let him finish before whipping forward, having full intent to
    stab Nobody through the chest and kill him before another word could be
    uttered. But he
    <i>
        dodged.
        <br/>
        <br/>
    </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Woah-ho! Excited, are we?”</i>
    Nobody flipped around, and began using his hands to knock away the incoming
    strikes. His sword seemed to be a last resort. After embarrassing her with
    how effortless it was to swipe her attacks away, he jabbed Alecto a couple
    times with curled firsts, slapping her away. But while his hand-to-hand
    skills were a match for Team Lance’s duelist, a test against the purveyor
    of fisticuffs was sure to come.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Be careful!” Selene tiptoed away.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer fared better than his predecessor, likely because while Nobody
    didn’t lack tactics and speed, he wasn’t as light on his feet. His shoes
    went through one of the planks upholding everyone, thus he lost his
    balance. But from the stress of his chortles, he wasn’t too concerned about
    catching stray blows.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Meaning to tip the odds back in his favor, Nobody upgraded to the sword.
But his use of it was very peculiar, mainly that it was still    <b>sheathed.</b> In this form, the sword was useless. So ineffective was
    this routine that despite running circles around Lucifer with the upgraded
    weaponry, none of his pummels actually <i>did</i> anything.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re trying to game me. And I’m not willing to play.” Mixing firearms
    and kick-based techniques, a blaze of bruising bullets and bashes put the
    Delphic on his back. What couldn’t be managed was a downward pike worthy of
    chopping someone’s Aura to ribbons. Nobody was willing to let most horrors
    slip past him, but he cut down advances of <i>that</i> caliber.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Among the chaos, Selene backed into something. What it was, she couldn’t
    see, until <i>Nadia</i> confessed her presence and consoled her best
    friend. “We’ll take care of him. It’s going to be alright. Go make sure the
    townspeople are safe, okay?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “O-Okay! Be careful!” Selene nodded, then joined Merlin in running to
    cover. Within the houses, she couldn’t find anyone alive, <i>or</i> dead.
    Whatever Nobody had done, however horrible or generous, a ghost-town was
    the result.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “This is so weird. What did he do?” Selene crouched down, raising one of
    her brows at Merlin. Her guardian, and voice of reason, shrugged before
    glimpsing upward at the melody of discord upon the roof. Nobody crashed
    through, throttling Lucifer by the neck.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Why do you hunt us!? What are you after?” He gasped, struggling to break
    free.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “I want you to <b>stop</b> wasting my time, and-”

    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto tackled this fiend back, and willfully initiated a test of strength,
    wherein she tried her hardest with her golden claymore to overwhelm him,
    and his saber which rested encased even still. But first, she had some
    choice words simmering deep inside.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Why are you handicapping yourself, <i>monster?</i> Pull out that katana,
and face me blade to blade like a <i>real</i> warrior! Or are you too    <i>tender!?”</i> She grit her teeth, furiously fumbling with her words.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Hahaha! But you don’t <b>really</b> want that, my dear. My insistence
        against such a heinous crime is what’s allowed you to get this far!
        Trust me, if I wanted to finish you, I’d have you dead before you hit
        the ground.”
    </i>
    To make his point, Nobody summersaulted backwards, clipping her jaw with
    his boot and knocking the knight flat on her back.
    <i>
        “Keraseer? When you’re done eating dirt, show me what the title truly
        means. Don’t hold back, I want to see the deadly power focused with
        that blade- I want to witness what sort of indignant <b>cruelty</b>
        your pitiful Lord bestowed upon thee. Don’t keep me waiting! Ack!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
Merlin punted him by surprise, initiating a combo that worked for a    <i>two</i> reasons. The animal was small, and hard to predict. His
    movements were far too precise in tandem with his size, meaning defense was
    an improbability, and damage an undisputed impossibility.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This all worked, but that’s only because it was apparent this dark
    gladiator wasn’t really <i>trying.</i> He was toying with Team Lance,
    crippling himself by using a sheathed blade, and Nadia could have sworn she
    spotted him yawn in between his effortless evasions. <i>She</i> finally
    found an opening after Nobody caught Merlin’s every move and swung him
    through the resident fireplace.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nadia’s huge misplay was believing herself, the ultimate assassin applauded
    by Beacon Academy for her swift mobility and stealth, to be faster than the
    Grimm Tactician. He brushed off her aimed pierce with a parry, granted
    there was enough power for Nobody to slide back on locked legs so he could
    return to bullying Lucifer. Having barely gotten to his feet, he was less
than pleased to get forced to the floor by his face.    <b><i>“Try playing dead.”</i></b> Finally, Lucifer’s Aura gave out.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “You’ve been properly broken. But I cannot risk your death yet. Stay
        put.”
    </i>
    Nobody had been smacked around quite a bit throughout the brawl, but things
    were looking increasingly up for him. Next to lose was Alecto, whose blind
    rage led her to do exactly what Lucifer had predicted. One backhand out the
    door, and her Aura was fleshly depleted. <i>Nobody</i> followed her
    outside.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Alright, the hard way.”</i>
    He brushed off his shoulders, sighing and striding past her prone body
    towards Nadia. The panic at seeing her friends fall one by one was obvious.
    From her expression to her body language, she was dismayed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Um, Alecto? G-Get up! Get up, please.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Calm yourself, Descendant. I’m not here to kill you.”</i>
    He rolled his eyes, looking at the skies for a moment.
    <i>
        “Beautiful sunset, huh? Perfect backdrop for our first encounter…
        Where’d you go- <b>Argh!” </b>
    </i>
    <b>

        </p>
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nadia impaled him from behind, pumping as much venom as possible before he
    broke away. Even with him missing attacks to ensure a few extra rakes of
    the lethal claws, she couldn’t snowball the small victory into anything
    substantial. <i>“Don’t try it, Descendant! I know your tricks!”</i> Not a
    second later, Nobody cornered her against another hut, with an abyss no
    more than a few feet away.

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>

<p>
    “Lucifer! C’mon, Lucifer! You can’t be beaten!” Selene shook his limp body,
    threatening to cry. When her voice cracked, his hand twitched.

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>

    “S-Selene… Summon him.” He rolled over, undoing his visor to look her in
    the eyes. “You have to summon Royal Necrocyst

    between Nobody and Nadia.

    “Yes, I will.” Boreas held the Beryl Rhinestone up, building up its energy.
    “Let’s just hope it’s enough.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nobody froze, eyes widening and becoming innocent at the sight of the
    magenta gemstone. He didn’t bother doing anything to avoid the incoming
    shockwave. And although he had plenty of Aura to spare, he appeared beaten
    once the smoke cleared. Silence followed, the Grimm kneeling and panting.

    Nobody slowly returned to his feet, smiling with more than petty victory.
    It seemed as though a great weight had been pulled from his shoulders.
    <i>
        “Last time I encountered a human here, they gave me nothing but lies

    owner.

    Sliding his sword back in its place, Nobody scratched out a gross metallic
    sound that was assumed to be horrendous even from Vale, with how much it
    echoed. This call drew out a Griffon, upon which Nobody saddled. His
    coasting through the clouds was the obvious next move. Not another soul
    objected, not even Boreas, who felt making sure the health of his allies
    remained prosperous was top priority.

    “Alecto! Alecto!” He rattled the suit of armor around, then followed his
    gut feeling. Dousing her in the right <i>potion</i> had the desired effect.
    It was entirely likely, in fact, that he had gone <i>too</i> intense with
    the choice of concoction.

    <i>“Ah!”</i>
    She jolted up, nearly knocking a weak and recently recovered Lucifer down.
    “Where’s the <i>Delphic!?”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>

    “He escaped. Rode off on another Grimm, as seems to be his character.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Damn it!” She punished the ground, breaking it under her fist before
    entering a screaming fit. “How could I, a <i>Keraseer,</i> let him go after
    everything that’s happened!? Am I <i>stupid?</i> By the <b>gods,</b>
    <i>
        if I see him again, I won’t stop until there’s nothing left! And a
        Grimm will <b>never</b> shame me again!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>

<p>
    Lucifer tried to lay a hand on her shoulder. “It’s alright. We’ll get
    another chance.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto roared, swung her claymore back, and chucked it forward with
    everything she had. As opposed to Nobody’s <i>one</i> tree, <b>ten</b>
    found themselves facing dire consequences at the hands of the Keraseer.
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>

<p>
    “Enough. Why are you acting like this? Explain your hatred of Delphics.
    Everyone knows Grimm are a plague to be purged, and I don’t need to make a
    case for why I detest Nobody, but <i>none</i> of us have such fervent ire
    for Delphics like you do. Tell me the truth.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Selene recovered from her hike to make sure Merlin was okay. He was now
    snuggled in her embrace, tired. “You can tell us, Alecto.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “You don’t want the truth. Trust me. This is my curse to carry. No one
        else’s.”
    </i>
    There was a detectable, shaky anguish paired with that statement. And with
    that, she was gone.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>

    “This isn’t how this is supposed to go.” Nadia groaned. “I thought we
    agreed- no more secrets.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer quelled her worries. “We did. But everyone has something they hold
    close to their chest, even in the most intimate of friendships.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>

        “Even you?”

<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer glanced back, but failed to meet Nadia’s eyes.
