<p>
    ”Do you think I’m a <em>fool?”</em> Mania asked. “I never thought you one
    to play games, Sister Artemis. To think, one of us would assist Trajan?
    It’s <em>laughable!” </em>
</p>
<p>
    “She’s right, you know? Mania never laughs!” Styx said.
</p>
<p>
    “I’m sorry to say, you’ll find no games to be had here. Have a look for
    yourself.” Artemis threw the tablets down, scattering them across a table
    that had been carved to form a map of Remnant.
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Stop! Don’t look- I forbid it!”</em>
    Mania commanded, ensuring herself and others did not violate the doctrine
    of knowledge, and skip ahead in their teachings.
</p>
<p>
    “It’s all there, if you don’t believe me. Lady Clotho wrote them, and you
    are correct, she withheld them till the end. For what reasons, I’m not
    sure. She has foretold the return of Trajan at our hands- one of us, to be
precise. And their true name is Xiasma. There’s no reason to hide    <em>that.” </em>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s not your place to say.”
</p>
<p>
    “Then whose is it?”
</p>
<p>
    A long pause swept past. Each and every member stood silent within this
    atrium, all present but hopeless to find the words.
</p>
<p>
“I won’t break the order. I can’t. When will this betrayal take place?    <em>You</em> tell <em>us.”</em> Eleanor said.
</p>
<p>
    “…Long from today.”
</p>
<p>
    “Then I will worry about it <strong>tomorrow.</strong> My suggestion? You
    all do the same. It’s is a lot to take in, clearly, but it’s Lady Clotho’s
    plan. She must have some sort of end goal in mind. We just have to look
    deeper.”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Inculto.” </em>
    Artemis nodded. “We will discuss this another time. Until then, occupy
    yourselves with Grimm.”
</p>
<p>
    “So, do the usual thing we’ve done for centuries?” Styx stole a glance at
    Diana, who hid at the next comment. “That is, <em>most</em> of us.”
</p>
<p>
    “Sh-She’s right.” Diana admitted. “But I still want to help in any way I
    can. I can lend one of you Tormentyst-”
</p>
<p>
    Artemis granted an ultimatum. “No. If you’d like to help, you can join me
    for prayer in the Cathedral, if you so wish. And what about <em>you?”</em>
</p>
<p>
    “I’ll pass <em>this</em> time. Should stretch a bit, you know?” Eleanor
    gave each of her friends a hug, then retreated with Eos, who’d been
    standing idle behind her the entire time, silent. Both turned in unison.
    With the slow but absolute dissipation of the crowd, the two found
    themselves isolated in a room marked by rows of seats, the golden walls
    serving as a battleground between lamps and paintings. <em></em>
</p>
<p>
    “So… <em>That’s</em> a thing that just happened.” Eleanor joked as she took
    a seat, detecting a hint of sarcasm in Eos’ response.
</p>
<p>
    “You find it <em>funny,</em> I see.”
</p>
<p>
    “Well, it <em>is</em> madness. There’s no chance a traitor can go unheard
of. This isn’t a guild with hundreds of members, it’s a    <em>sisterhood.</em> There’s only <strong>six</strong> of us. If any of you
    ever gave any reason for suspicion, we’d have seen it by now.”
</p>
<p>
    “Then that begs the question.” Eos admitted. “Who’s Xiasma?”
</p>
<p>
    “…Okay. Let’s go through this one at a time. Neither you nor I are the
    traitor. Sister Artemis is the oldest among us, and if she was planning
    anything, she wouldn’t have told us. And Sister Styx has the greatest
hatred for the Creatures of Grimm. Only two remain, but I doubt Sister    <em>Diana</em> would be capable of something like this, considering her
    age. Too innocent. She doesn’t even know who Trajan <em>is,</em> does she?”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“But what about Sister Mania?</em>
    There’s not a chance she’d ever come to the aid of our enemy. It’s out of
    the question.”
</p>
<p>
    “And… Each of us feels the same. I believe that.” Eleanor sighed, bringing
    her feet onto the bench.
</p>
<p>
    <br/>
    Mania opened the doors, her intentions clear. She had been waiting on the
other side, listening in. “I think we get it. Nobody here fits the bill.    <em>Who’s</em> the traitor? None can say.”
</p>
<p>
    “Eavesdropping, huh?” Eleanor pointed. “Now <em>that’s</em> something a
    traitor would do.”
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, please.” They migrated outside the walls of the temple. “This is
    trivial. There is but one way to resurrect Trajan- with his name said, it
    is clear. His <em>flames</em> are the key. None of us know where they are.
    Whoever does is obfuscating the truth.”
</p>
<p>
    As soon as they left the near sightless barrier, the dynamic changed, as it
    often did when someone arrived unannounced.
</p>
<p>
    “Obfuscating the truth? I’m not obfuscating anything!” Troy declared. “Er,
I don’t think I am. I don’t even like obfuscate... So, who’s    <em> ‘Obfuscate’?”</em>
</p>
<p>
    “…It’s not him.” Mania laughed. “He doesn’t have the wits to be a
    mastermind. Hold up. Take off those ridiculous glasses.”
</p>
<p>
    “Pretty sweet shades, huh? I could part with them, at a discount.”
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, perfect. No silver eyes. As such, he’s exempt from Lady Clotho’s
    prediction.”
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t know if you noticed, but he’s also <em>not a sister.</em> That’s
    sort of important.” Eleanor said.
</p>
<p>
    “Let me guess- that also means I’m exempt from your mythical clubhouse
    secrets, eh?” Troy nodded as though he understood any of this. “But I am a
    quick learner. I can piece it together, I’m sure of it. I mean, just look
    at that guy over there! He’s much slower than I, wouldn’t you say?”
</p>
<p>
    “Abigor!” Eleanor straightened her posture at his presence. Why are you
    here?”
</p>
<p>
    “Aha.” Mania pat her on the back. “Enjoy yourselves. I’ve got Grimm to
    butcher. I’ll bring back a souvenir!”
</p>
<p>
    “Eleanor.” Abigor set down a massive wheel barrow stocked with black pelts
    and horns. “I figured now would be a good time to bring in the spoils of
    the last few hunts. This isn’t a bad time, is it?”
</p>
<p>
    She and Eos exchanged a brief glance. “No. Everything’s fine.”
</p>
<p>
    “Ha. I taught the Seventh Brigade never to lie. You don’t spend eight years
    on the line without picking up-“
</p>
<p>
    “Picking up some tricks, I <em>know.”</em> She snorted. “We’ve happened
    upon something big.”
</p>
<p>
    Eos interrupted. “No. This is business as usual. There is nothing of note
    to discuss. Leave it at that.”
</p>
<p>
    “…What did I just say about lying?”
</p>
<p>
    “This time, we are tending matters beyond the concern of humans, as
    welcome…” She eyed Troy. “Or <em>unwelcome,</em> as they may be.”
</p>
<p>
    “Huh. I know better than to push and pry against <em>you.”</em> Abigor
    snorted. “But I’m a tad concerned. Have I not proved my loyalty? I mean, I
    could always leave now, if you’re too busy.”
</p>
<p>
    “N-No, stay! I-I mean, just in case anything happens.” Eleanor said, her
    face reddening under her helmet.
</p>
<p>
    “What could ever happen around here?” Troy said.
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Shut it!</em>
    Or I’ll… I’ll turn you to stone!”
</p>
<p>
    “Oh.” He gasped, the start a grin smearing itself onto his face.
“Everyone’s passed rumors of the six paladins sent for hire.    <em>Higher <strong>power,</strong> that is.</em> Everyone loves you guys.
    Even me- but that sort of knowledge comes with a few perks.
    <em>
        You don’t have the spine to hurt me, Eleanor. I know you don’t. Go
        ahead!”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “She doesn’t.” Abigor dropped his supplies. “But I do.”
</p>
<p>
    “That’s not exactly the warm welcome I was expecting, chief.”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Captain.” </em>
</p>
<p>
    “R-Right.” Troy slowly backed into the wall of his mart. “Listen! Don’t
    kill me, and I’ll give you a lien bonus. Five percent off all weaponry!
    Stop! If you spend <strong>ten</strong> more credits than usual, I’ll
    reimburse you <strong>nine!</strong> <em>Wait!” </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Not good enough, I’m afraid.”
</p>
<p>
    “Let him go.” Eleanor laughed, along with Eos, who mustered a chuckle.
</p>
<p>
    “Fine, but I’m holding him to his discount.”
</p>
<p>
    Had another intruder arrived, Eleanor may have begun questioning whether or
not it was so wise to hide the Heart of the Coven proficiently, rather than<em>religiously.</em> Yet, if that third party watched    <em>unannounced,</em> everyone would win.
</p>
<p>
    “Look at them, chirping like little birds!” Herald giggled gleefully, until
    he spotted one nearby. “Hey! Get out of here! Tell that witch to keep you
    away, or I’ll spit roast you!<em> C’mon… </em>Where’s that bloody sword!?”
</p>
<p>
    He knew from the sound of fractured reality, he was no longer alone. That
    phenomena was commonplace, for an Oathkeeper clad in bloody rags.
    <strong>
        <em>
            “That ‘sword’ is more than an heirloom, it is a trophy of the
            King’s victory over the damned. I will not prevent you from
            insulting the Coven, but I demand you apply some restraint for
            Tormentyst.”
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah, but you’d think they’d whip it out every now and then, if it was so
    special. Ugh, <em>bo-ring!”</em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <em>
            “Trophies are hung on the wall, Herald, not flaunted onto the field
            of battle.”
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    “That wouldn’t be the case if it wasn’t given to some simpleton with zero
experience. What a joke, this coven is. No. It should’ve gone to    <em>me,</em> at least. I actually know how to swing one, you know.”
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <em>
            “You covet that power for yourself, is that it? Hahaha! Diana is
            owed the sword, by Clotho. If you want it, you’ll need silver eyes,
            let alone ones stronger than hers. It is a quest with no end. Best
            you leave behind these dreams, and focus on the objective presented
            before you, by myself. With the Rhinestone’s finding, you are free
            to chase the stars.”
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Herald formed a worrying smile. “Really?”
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <em>
            “You’ll find no wrath from me. Just pray for what the Coven will
            do, if you snuff out their brightest light… Clotho won’t be happy,
            either. Hubris, Herald, hubris. It is tempting, but no eternity of
            torture is worth such a price. Well, except one.”
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    “Aha. And, what price would that be?”
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>“Leave it to me.”</em></strong>
