                 
<p>
    Alone, in the outer moat of the Coven, under the cloak of harmony, Eleanor
    stretched upon a sheet of leaves. The rapid waterfalls masked any other
sound but her lullabies, until Abigor ruined everything with his constant    <em>talking. </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Who can tell the best joke?”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“You win.” </em>
</p>
<p>
That drew a laugh, surprisingly enough. “Nonsense. You must’ve seen    <em>something</em> funny since the last time we played this game.”
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah. Your face.”
</p>
<p>
“…So be it.” He snickered, mocking her monotone disinterest. “Why don’t you    <em>‘face’ </em>me in a duel, then?”
</p>
<p>
    “Ugh! That was your worst one yet.” Eleanor admitted.
</p>
<p>
    “Just think about it, a little. Experience is the best practice. Imagine
    how much we could learn from each other. You could even pick up a thing or
    two about <em>strategy,</em> and <em>I</em> could learn how to <em>run</em>
    from battle.”
</p>
<p>
    “Hey!” Eleanor sat up. “I don’t run from battle! It’s called a tactical
    retreat. You already know, but I’ll repeat nonetheless. I won’t <em>fight</em> you,
    even for sport. I can’t hurt you.”
</p>
<p>
    “You could <em>never</em> hurt me.”
</p>
<p>
    Eleanor picked up a stray rock and charged a throw. A bluff, as usual.
    “You’re ridiculous.”
</p>
<p>
    “Fine, fine. A shame. Could’ve been a nice warm up for the mission,
    considering you’re forcing me to travel alone. Where do you want me to go,
    again?”
</p>
<p>
    “You’re not alone, fool. You, along with Herald, are going to find what’s
    called a <strong>Beryl Rhinestone.</strong>”<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <em>“…Why?” </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Our little secret. We’ve been over this: Herald’s translation demands it.”
</p>
<p>
    “Then why am I running errands? Couldn’t you, or anyone from around here,
    get the job done without error? You’re not trying to get rid of me, are
    you?”
</p>
<p>
    “Blame Herald. His navigation skills and familiarity with region soon to be
    ventured has brought a mission that cannot be completed without him. Yet,
    our own relations with last <em>several</em> Heralds of Kyradin Bael
    resulted in their death, at the hands of Aku’s crew, who seem to follow us
    wherever we go. It’s why we spent years avoiding Herald until now. You’ll
    have to take our place.”
</p>
<p>
    “Finally, <em>I</em> get to play hero. I’ll thank Aku once I’ve beaten him.
    The guy’s all bark, I’m telling you.”
</p>
<p>
    “Listen.” She snorted.
    <em>
“Even as a Delphic, respect that it is more powerful than you, and it        <strong>is.</strong>
    </em>
    There are warriors who were vastly superior to you and me- as in, better by
    a factor of <em>ten.</em> They faced Aku with far greater caution than you
seem <em>capable</em> of exercising, and where are they now?    <em>Trophies.</em> Rumor has it, their bodies are used as decorations on
    the <strong>Falsus Heredis.”</strong>
</p>
<p>
    “…What a silly name, for a silly guy.”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Hahaha.</em>
    Oh, you’re <em>so</em> dead when the time comes.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re right about <em>one</em> thing. The fight will be decided    <strong>before</strong> any blades meet. Skill is certainly nice, but
    without brains, it’s worthless. And yet, we’re speaking about a master
    enslaved by their own pets, too cowardly to enter battle unless threatened by
    them. Don’t you see? Equipment and planning is key. You should know
    something about that- always concealed by armor. Come to think of it, it’s
    not often I get to see you <em>without</em> your helmet. Why not try one
    day without it?”
</p>
<p>
    “Y-You know I can’t. A Descendant exposing themselves to another of lesser
    creed in such a manner is frowned upon.” Eleanor looked away.
</p>
<p>
    “You’re always going on about silver eyes, but I hardly ever have a chance
    to see them. I bet they’re still gorgeous as ever.”
</p>
<p>
    Eleanor’s face reddened, not that he could tell, yet. Defensively, she
    scanned the area only to spot one of Artemis’ vultures. <em>“Shoo.”</em>
    Begrudgingly, the obedient bird flapped through the forest roof, cutting a
    path for sunlight. No longer masked by the shining armor, Eleanor and
    Abigor quickly found each other’s eyes. As they inched closer, neither
    spoke a word.
</p>
<p>
    <em>“I’ve got wares fit for heirs, fellow travelers. Don’t be shy!”</em>
    Troy hummed, slicing his way through the thick foliage with a dull cutlass.
    Thankfully, he was slow. Instinctively, Eleanor scrambled to place her
    helmet back on, Abigor’s contagious laughter doing little to help but
    plenty to hinder. “Ah, <em>you</em> two. What’s so funny?”
</p>
<p>
    “N-Nothing!” Eleanor blared out, pleading with a stare at Abigor. He
    relented.
</p>
<p>
    “Just telling old stories.” He lied. “Gearing up for a new assignment, as a
    matter of fact. Typical zealous work. You know, the usual.”
</p>
<p>
Eleanor cleared her throat and stood up. “Not that you have any    <em>right</em> to know. There’s a long history of Coven benefactors who
    didn’t realize the danger they put themselves in through sheer proximity to
    us. You should move on.”
</p>
<p>
Troy feigned offense. “Hey, I’m human, same as him! The    <em>Ferryman for the Coven</em> ought to be clued in a bit, wouldn’t you
    say?”
</p>
<p>
    “The difference between you and <em>me,”</em> Abigor scoffed. “Is that I’m
the <em>renowned Captain of the Seventh Brigade,</em> and you’re    <em>Troy.” </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Eh… No shortage of self-esteem issues, are there?”
</p>
<p>
    “The numbers of soldiers I’ve outlived? It’s no question you’ll sit among
    them. I hope it’s not too far to say that someone like <em>you</em> has
    poor chances of surpassing me.”
</p>
<p>
“B-But you’ll still need someone to take you there! Wherever    <em>‘there’ </em>is. I’m the guy for the job. Ask anyone, I get around a
    lot! Back me up here, Eleanor!”
</p>
<p>
    She yawned. “Nobody here even knows where Summit’s Blight <em>is.</em> Only
    Herald holds such information. <em>He</em> decides who’ll take the trip.”
</p>
<p>
    <em> “Oho! I’m touched!”</em>
    The faunus himself intervened, skipping maniacally. “Don’t worry, you can
    bow later.”
</p>
<p>
    “You mean I’m in?” Troy said.
</p>
<p>
    “The more I bring with me, the less likely <em>I’ll</em> be the one to
    die.”
</p>
<p>
    “What <em>are</em> you doing here?” Eleanor stretched. “Come, quick. If a
    bunch of Descendants are going to stand around, we’d best do it under the
    protection of Clotho’s blessing.”
</p>
<p>
    “What about us!?” Both humans questioned in unison.
</p>
<p>
    “If you want, you may tag along.” Herald said. “You might get more than you
    bargained for, though. See for yourself. But, with better weapons, I’m sure
    any and all threats will disappear. Why don’t I give Tormentyst a try? You
    know, recompense for the death of the previous Heralds.”
</p>
<p>
    “No.” Eleanor assumed a defensive posture. “The sword stays with its
    rightful owner.”
</p>
<p>
    “…What if I offered her a lesson in the Old Arts?”
</p>
<p>
    “Impossible. That’s the most cherished form of meditative combat conceived.
    It is reserved for Heralds and Keraseers. You’re either desperate beyond
    reason, or insane, if you’re willing to give it up for a sword. Move
    along.”
</p>
<p>
    “O-Of course. Slip of the tongue.” His apology resulted in the withdrawal
    of all but Eleanor, who was left to ponder alone. She waved Abigor goodbye.
</p>
<p>
    Crossing the channel was a task made trivial through the use of Gaius’
    warships. Any incoming Grimm <em>under</em> the age of a century would’ve
    been diced, their hastily disintegrating parts scattered across the ocean
    by the revolutionary cannons on deck. More important was the confidence
    they <em>inspired.</em> The lack of doubt deterred Grimm.
</p>
<p>
    “Well. This is nice.” Troy mumbled, setting up shop on a beach. The sun
    never slackened. To his side, Herald stepped off the ship and began a march
    towards a cluster of silver, upraised canyons ahead.
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah, sure. This is like a no-man’s continent. Paradise for some, I’m
    sure. But I can’t stand the heat, and this sunshine’s giving me a headache.
You’d think a place this remote might have some rain, but no. <em>‘Summit’s Blight’</em> is basically ripe for plundering. The    <strong>rumors</strong> have scared everyone away.”
</p>
<p>
    “What rumors?”
</p>
<p>
    As they traversed deeper and deeper, even <em>Herald</em> had to admire
what was, at <em>worst,</em> an arid land untouched by mortal greed. “You    <em>really</em> want to know? There was this gem called the Meridian. Worth
    so much value was it that countless thieves and bandits starved trying to
    reach it. Eventually, one pack of them succeeded. The cursed diamond
    trapped them together, until the only way to survive was to <em>eat</em>
each other. My guess? They found what we’re looking for, now. The    <em>Beryl Rhinestone.” </em>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s ridiculous.” Abigor stated.
</p>
<p>
    “You’re right. I made it up, to gauge your intelligence. You passed.”
</p>
<p>
    “Ha. My turn. Why are we here? What does the Rhinestone do?”
</p>
<p>
    “Fine, fine. I’m sure the silvery-eye-simpletons couldn’t be bothered to
    tell <em>you.”</em> Herald quickly retracted his insult once Abigor held a
    blade to his back. “Oh! I-I misspoke! Listen. Squeezing information out of
    the Coven is as fruitless an endeavor as these <em>trees.”</em> He smacked
    one to make his point. “If knowledge is power, they have the means to crush
    anyone. But I am not bound by such an oath of secrecy.”
</p>
<p>
    “Spit it out. I’ve known Eleanor for years but she’s never parted her
    history.”
</p>
<p>
    “There are four gods. That’s the hierarchy of Keres, Hestia, Clotho, and
    Trajan, from highest to lowest faith. The Beryl Rhinestone was the jewel of
    Hestia’s prized necklace, gifted as a symbol of peace by Trajan, before the
    Second Bewitchment. When an object is imbued with such power, and made so
    pivotal in the quest of gods, it becomes transcendent in purpose. That’s
    how the game of Relics is played. There is, if you can believe it, a fifth
    deity. My instructor, <em>Kyradin Bael.</em> He is the only one who still
    walks Remnant.”
</p>
<p>
    “Mhm.” Troy frantically jotted everything down.
</p>
<p>
    “So, what’s the Second Bewitchment? And the relevance of the stone?” Abigor
    asked.
</p>
<p>
    “It’s a tad complicated, but I’ll try to make it easy so you two slugs can
    understand. Let’s start with <em>‘Lore: 101.’</em> There were two supreme
    beings. Their feud brought Grimm <em>and</em> humanity- one for each’s
    dogma. Eventually, from the strife of humanity, they caused the First
    Bewitchment, and shortly departed. Think of it like a curse that spanned
    the continent, brought on by the darker, less charitable maker. But his
    brother was a fan of <em>balance.” </em>
</p>
<p>
    Abigor tilted his head. “Let me guess. Not satisfied, he summoned the five
    gods we worship today, to rule over whatever might’ve remained.”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Close.”</em>
Herald admitted. “He summoned three. <em>Keres, Slayer of Heretics. Hestia, Blood of the Pure.</em> And    <em>Clotho, Scourge of the Grimm.</em> The Dark Brother, let’s call him,
    wouldn’t be outdone. He spawned <em>Trajan, Spawn of the Damned, </em>as an
    infiltrator. It was that choice that led to a long conflict, and the Second
    Bewitchment. This time, <strong>just </strong>the Gods were exiled, and
humanity, faunus, and Delphics were spared. Now, we’re alone. Frankly,    <em>I</em> see it as a good thing.”
</p>
<p>
    “I see. How does the Rhinestone play into all this?”
</p>
<p>
“The only way to bring back Trajan is with the    <strong>Rhinestone, </strong>or the <strong>Black Dust.” </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <em>“What!?” </em>
</p>
<p>
The details of his story washed over the ignorant, the implications    <em>too</em> enlightening. They only stopped to check their surroundings
    once a sign had been reached.
</p>
<p>
    “Anti-Citadel?” Troy read out nervously.
</p>
<p>
    “Yep. This area was a favorite of the first Herald. He’d come here often, naming
    it in secret to ensure whatever was hidden would not be disturbed. Of
    course, nobody knew that until these terrible tablets came to light. How
    fortunate.”
</p>
<p>
    “What was he trying to hide?”
</p>
<p>
    “You’re <em>inviting</em> me to make up scary stories, at this point.”
</p>
<p>
    Abigor changed subjects, walking down a stack of carved stairs towards a
frighteningly tall vault, constructed from wood. “What about the fifth god?<em>‘The Arbiter’?</em> Where did <strong>he</strong> come from? How did    <strong>he</strong> survive Trajan’s war, and the Second Bewitchment?”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Nobody knows.”</em>
</p>
<p>
    “Uh, guys?” Troy interrupted, thoroughly <em>past</em> the entrance.
    “What’s that?”
</p>
<p>
    But they needn’t any warning, for the Grimm ahead was impossible to miss
    once light flooded the cavern. Ensnared in diabolical chains, seemingly
    asleep, <strong><em>Galathyn</em></strong> rested beneath a <em>cloud</em>
    that broke the otherwise cheery mood. This fog was tirelessly thick, with
    unnatural tendrils fighting in vain to expand the cramped space.
</p>
<p>
    “The <em>Rhinestone!”</em> Withholding a celebration was nearly beyond
    Herald. “See? That thing’s holding it. Once we get the stone, I’ll be free
    to carry out my dreams in peace!”
</p>
<p>
    “Wait.” Abigor boomed. “You need discipline. We have no idea what we’re
    going up against, here.”
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, where did all that confidence go?”
</p>
<p>
    “There’s a time and a place, Troy. Joking about the horrors of bloodshed is
    how <em>many</em> of us cope with it, but if you treat the warpath as one
    does the <em>flower fields</em>, then <em>that</em> is where you’ll be
    buried. Herald! Do you know what that thing is?”
</p>
<p>
    “Not like any Grimm <em>I’ve</em> ever seen. Must be one of a kind. Legend
spoke of the spider Grimm nicknamed the Grand Gatekeeper,    <em>Galathyn,</em> but said nothing of the Rhinestone’s involvement. You
    may have noticed, but it’s not easy being a historian.”
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        “Easier than a soldier. We <strong>make</strong> history. You simply
        observe it.”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Shhhhh!”</em>
    Troy hooted. “I think it’s sleeping!”
</p>
<p>
    Herald sighed. “Oh, that’s right, you’re a genius. <em>Obviously</em> it’s
    stuck in a permanent trance, idiot. Look, we can’t just stand here. The
    goal’s <em>right there.” </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Remove that Rhinestone, and you’ll unleash Galathyn.” Abigor said.
</p>
<p>
    “I think we can handle Trajan’s little pet. I thought this story more of a
    lie than myth, but it’s clear now. The Almighty Keres must’ve used his
    second in command’s necklace as a lock, to seal away the blight brought by
    this Grimm. <em>Bigger, faster,</em> and more <em>relentless</em> than the
    rest, Galathyn remains in the minds of children, tales of its rage enough
    to keep them tucked away in their houses at night.”
</p>
<p>
    “And you want to <em>awaken</em> it?” Troy gasped.
</p>
<p>
    “How bad can it be? It’s trapped in this cave, anyway. Anything to get the
    Rhinestone, right?” Without waiting for confirmation, Herald swiped the
    stone away. Immediately, the floor shook, every barren torch in the mine
    igniting with purple flames.
</p>
<p>
    As the bonds fell away, splashing into dust upon impact with the floor, the
    full scale of Galathyn was realized. The ceiling nearly caved in, the space
    unbelievably cramped given the situation. Each of the three marauders
    gulped. Mounting a fight in these conditions was impossible, and for the
    first time since its imprisonment, Galathyn <em>screamed.</em> It went
    ballistic, smashing its way towards the gate.
</p>
<p>
“Watch out!” Abigor tackled his allies to safety. Galathyn was    <em>gone.</em> Yet, more concerning was the gray mist that now creeped out
    into open air, turning the paradise of Summit’s Blight into an
    uncompromising land of storms. They followed the clouds outside cautiously.
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, thank the gods we’re alive.” Troy panted.
</p>
<p>
Herald praised his new souvenir closely, analyzing every glimmer and <em>perfect</em> oddity. “Yes! It’s mine!    <em>It’s <strong>all</strong> mine!</em> The things I’ll accomplish with
    the spoils of this Stone! <em>Kyradin will finally free me!”</em>
</p>
<p>
    “What? No. It must be taken back to Eleanor.” Abigor demanded.
</p>
<p>
    “…Consider for yourself the sort of crisis this world would be subject to
    if the Rhinestone ended up in the wrong hands. Someone in the Coven craves
    that outcome. Keeping this thing <em>away</em> from Xiasma is the smartest
    thing we could do, right now. I hate to be the one to say it, but Eleanor
    is playing you. Deep down, you <em>know</em> I’m right.”
</p>
<p>
    Abigor watched the clouds expand beyond the ocean, their mistake becoming
    more drastic by the moment.
    <em>
        “Xiasma? What’s he talking about? Why does he desire this relic, so?”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Then, something <em>clicked.</em> Herald’s concerning words throughout the
    day repeated in his head.
    <em>
        “’Once we get the stone, I’ll be free to carry out my goal in peace…
        The things I’ll accomplish with the spoils of this Stone...’”
    </em>
    And then, Eleanor’s suspicions clarified everything.
    <em>
        “’You’re either desperate beyond reason, or insane, if you’re willing
        to give it up for a sword.’”<strong></strong>
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Abigor quickly changed demeanors, readying his weaponry, cutting off Herald’s
    path.
    <em>
        “No! You want the Rhinestone so you can cheat Clotho’s Coven out of
        Tormentyst!”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Just couldn’t let it go, could you?” Herald, even without a weapon,
    managed to evade each and every sword wipe. Even his costume, passed down
    from the previous Old Fang beneficiary, remained untouched by the deadly
    blade. And when the opportunity presented itself, Abigor was rewarded with
    brutal fists and kicks.
</p>
<p>
    All of that changed once Troy intervened. True to his word, the merchant
    was no stranger to combat. Relatively inexperienced as he was, he must’ve
    learned from Abigor’s proverbs, as the dominance in numbers helped
    exponentially.
</p>
<p>
    It wouldn’t last. His approach relied on dust enhanced mobility, and after
    Herald <em>stopped time</em> and clawed away the cloak holding Herald’s
    provincials, the field was once again evened. Both allies, frozen, were
    subject to gauntlet of rives.
</p>
<p>
    Abigor, in desperation, leapt away and attempted to signal the Seventh
    Brigade, with an incantation and flare gun. The Old Arts had no end of
    tricks, as teleportation let Herald cut that tactic short, with a nasty
    grapple to the floor.
</p>
<p>
    What followed could only be describe as a tactician’s dream. Both of them
    realized quickly that the bout could only be determined by planning and
    strategy. The slippery, slimy, sneaking Herald and the honor-marked example
    of human endurance made a good match. Of course, stamina was the time
    limit.
</p>
<p>
    Herald was skilled, but too young and impulsive. The advanced manipulation
    of time and space came at a price of <em>Aura.</em> In staving off Clotho’s
    Coven for so many years due to derangements for the Black Horsemen, he
    lacked the experience Abigor acquired in droves. Retreat was the only way
    out.
</p>
<p>
“I-It doesn’t matter.” He reasoned. His limp slowly evolving into a run.    <strong>“I’ve</strong> got the Rhinestone, now.
    <em>
        And if you try to stop me, I promise Trajan won’t wait sleeping much
        longer.”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Follow him!” Abigor gasped, trying to push the boulders knocked onto him
    aside for a much needed breath. Troy pursued, but a turn of the corner
    brought a complete dead end.
</p>
<p>
    “What? Impossible. Where did he go?”
</p>
<p>
    “Foul magic. Something big was just released. We can blame it for this
    insipid rain.” One of Galathyn’s roars sent a chill through their already
    numbing bodies. “We shouldn’t have come here. Herald was willing to do
anything for <em>Tormentyst.</em> He knew what the    <em>‘Grand Gatekeeper’</em> was guarding. I’m betting he lied about the
    tablets brought to him, too. Were they even written by Kyradin Bael? I
should’ve expected nothing less from the Old Fang, let alone a    <em>Herald,</em> with the gall to disbar himself from other Descendants out
    of <em>fear.” </em>
</p>
<p>
    “So, what happens now?” Troy, despite his open surroundings, became
    dangerously claustrophobic at the concept of a shifting maze.
</p>
<p>
    “With Galathyn free, it seems this place no longer abides by the rules of
    reality. We’ve no choice but to move forward, and make it to the Coven
    before Herald. Perhaps that’s what he wanted all along: our entrapment. But
    it won’t work.”
</p>
<p>
    “Eleanor will come looking for us, right?”
</p>
<p>
    Abigor didn’t answer. But even now, as he struggled just to determine east
    from west, the thread keeping his allies together was in far worse
    condition. Eleanor wasn’t equipped to hunt the Rhinestone though she, and
    her peers, were eager to tackle a settlement thought untouched by maps. The
    path was set.
    <em>
        Perhaps among the reef-ridden sea of sunken ships and thunder, Artemis
        deduced, the dreaded Captain <strong>Aku’s </strong>death would bring
        answers.
