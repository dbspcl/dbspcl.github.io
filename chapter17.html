<p>
    Dimitri sat back, shirt unbuttoned, his legs on the table. Alongside them
    sat a milkshake that had been doused in alcohol.
    <i>
        “Nice of you to finally drop in. I’m surprised, although somewhat
        amused, to see the <b>White Fang</b> wouldn’t keep me hanging. Welcome
        aboard.”
    </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Erm, well, actually, uh… </i>
I-I’m not in the <i>White</i> Fang. I reside as <i>Herald,</i> of the    <i>Old</i> Fang.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Whatever you say, chap. You’re the first to show. You <i>know</i> who I
    am.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Y-Yes. You must be Dimitri. You sent me the heist invite, right? I was
    told to come to the second floor.” Herald tentatively sulked through one of
    the lower segments of the <i>Cross Continental Transmit Tower,</i> just to
    offer his hand.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ha!” Dimitri pretended to pull a weapon, but it turned out to just be the
    most common form of greeting. Herald still stumbled back, terrified.
    “That’s <i>me!</i> You didn’t happen to see any other mobsters outside, did
you? I’d prefer not to tackle this place with just <i>you</i> at my side,    <i>after all the work I put into attracting attention…</i> But the night
    is still young. I’d get comfy until the <i>real deal</i> begins.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well, uh, I did plant two sentries in the elevator! They’ll make sure that
    whoever walks in here <i>belongs</i> in here.” As he sat down at the end of
    an elongated dining table, across from Dimitri, he couldn’t help but fidget
    restlessly.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Most of the floors are already clear, both of witnesses and Atlas’
    cronies. You can thank <i>me</i> for that. Just don’t ask where they went,
    or I’ll throw you among them.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ahah…” Herald suddenly felt incredibly <i>alarmed</i> with his situation-
locked in a warehouse with one of Remnant’s most revered crime lords.    <i>“Grah! Why didn’t I send Naros here?</i> M-Maybe I should just leave!
    I’m sure there are plenty of other folks on their way, anyway! If that’s
    alright with you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“It <b>isn’t.”</b></i>
    Dimitri countered through clenched teeth, a smile forced across his lips.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The elevator took an exuberant amount of time to arrive, and when it
    finally did, Herald learned why. <i>“You!? Impossible! Gah!”</i> He
    crumpled to the ground, for ahead towered an iconic Servant who’d spent the
    last several weeks terrorizing all Herald stood for.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Do not panic. For all the times I’ve invaded your lands and decimated
        your men, those were <b>orders,</b> from Supreme Leader Caligula.”</i> Aamon’s eyes shone brighter. “I’m not here to kill you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Uhuh. Who the hell are <i>you?”</i> Dimitri asked, watching Aamon walk
    past to take a seat at the conference table. He expected plenty of scum to
    hear of his robbery, but not a mechanical apparatus capable of
    articulation, both in terms of speech and movement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“I am Aamon <i>‘HT3813,’</i> and I represent <b>Host</b> Aamon.    <i>‘AA0001,’ </i>that would be. He was told there was potentially much to
    gain from this operation. And once again, it is not my orders to
    assassinate you, <i>Herald.</i> You can stop <i>hyperventilating.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…A remote control robot. Cool.” Dimitri shrugged, shaking his head. “This
    is turning out to be quite the band of thieves. I’m pretty satisfied with
    that. Each of our <i>unique</i> skill sets ought to come into play. We are
    going to use that to search every inch of this hood. Herald! What can you
    do?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ah! Um… I can sneak around. I can turn into paper… I can <i>cook.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re blowing me away.” Dimitri held a pistol to his own head,
    contemplating whether or not listening to this <i>disappointment</i> was
    worth it.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He <i>is</i> stealthy. It’s more than <i>I</i> can say.” Aamon gave credit
    where it was due. “Aamon has <i>many</i> skills, most of them granted
    during our evolution. If you want to investigate this building, you’ll need
    to cover your tracks. I will locate the security office, and keep this questionable
    business venture under wraps.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You can manage that?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I cannot anticipate. But if history is to be trusted, I can do it and Vale
    will never even know we were here. It is a <i>massive</i> misstep to
    infiltrate any CCT-Tower without a plan to erase your existence.” Aamon
    reclined sideways, one arm rested on the desk. Now everyone sat across from
each other. “We are not to leave any trace. That’s what Aamon    <i>‘AA0001’ </i>instructed. And that makes things <i>difficult.</i> Which
    begs the question: Are we <i>alone?</i> Who else is scheduled to arrive?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    His question received a brisk answer. Within the elevator, a piercing clash
    became apparent. Inside, something terrible must’ve been happening. Dents
    were formed in the bay doors. And once they opened, both Old Fang members
    who had stood guard were tossed into the room like <i>trash.</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“There is a debt to be paid, my dear.” </i>
    Nobody sauntered into the facility. Without pause, he stomped onto the
    table and pranced over to Dimitri. Aamon examined the Delphic without
moving, even as Nobody nearly crushed his hand under an unrelenting boot. <i>Herald,</i> in contrast, trembled out of his chair in a panic.    <i>“And <b>I</b> am the collector.” </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ho!” Dimitri considered this change of pace a welcome addition, even as a
hand clasped around his collar and dangled him in the air. <b>“Oh! </b>    <i>Someone</i> has a breath problem!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Won’t smell half as bad as your corpse. You told me you’d return, and
        bring me to Augustus. You broke a promise. Now, you will die.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Haha- What do you think I’m doing here, <i>now,</i> anyway? Am I    <i>not</i> back in Vale? Are we <i>not</i> standing eye-to-eye again?”
    Dimitri bluffed. He wasn’t <i>scared</i> by any measure of the word, but
    he’d prefer to keep his head.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Why are all humans such liars?”</i>
    Nobody asked Herald, who quaked at his stare. Dimitri was still hanging by
    an unbreakable grip. “I’m a very pragmatic person, <i>Dimitri.</i> I told
you when you abandoned me, that if you did, I’d come <i>back.</i> I kept    <i>my</i> promise.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The difference is, I’m here <i>now.</i> I wouldn’t have returned to Vale
    if I didn’t expect to run into you- and, we both have our reasons for
    killing Augustus. <i>Good</i> reasons!” Dimitri was an unsung hero when it
    came to deception. Although he wasn’t the best, as <b>that</b> title was
    reserved for one other, he was able to at least <i>stall</i> Nobody. “But
before any of that, the task of snatching up that <i>Relic</i> before    <i>Salem</i> does falls to us! Sounds intriguing, eh?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Salem!? The <b>Moth…”</b></i>
    Nobody’s expression contorted into a scowl. As it turned out, Dimitri’s
    bargaining skills saved him more than cash this time. It saved him his
    life.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I feel it’s appropriate to inform you that <i>Supreme Leader Caligula</i>
    has plans to invade Summit’s Blight personally, and secure what is
    theorized to be hidden there- a powerful <i>faunus,</i> for this Moth.”
    Aamon let loose his master’s schedule. “He was more easily manipulated by
    the Seer than Prime Solomon thought possible.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Dimitri broke into laughter. “He’s going to Summit’s Blight, is he? Well,
    then. I just may have to pay him a visit. I’d like my fair share of bling.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“…Deer. </i>
    If this is true…” Nobody tossed the crook side. “Then we must move quickly.
    Herald, what’s the plan?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Th-The plan?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s right, my dear. You don’t stand a chance of stopping the Moth
    without me. Or, is it really the Moth you’re here to stop? You couldn’t
    possible care about the Relics, or you wouldn’t have such a fixation with
    Summit’s Blight.” With the table giving him a boost, he was nearly triple
    Herald’s height. “What are you <i>really</i> after?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Eck- I, uh, I’m just following orders?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>“Whose</i></b>
    <i>
        orders?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “My Lord’s orders!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Enough talk of lords and moths.”</i>
Aamon broke the two apart with his words, not needing to rise.<i>“I grow wary of men who think they can play the role of gods.</i> The    <b>Relic.</b> Where is it, Delphic? What floor of the CCT-Tower?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “My ignorance to that question shames me. If it’s here, it must be hidden
well. I will sweep every <i>floor,</i> every <i>vent,</i> and every    <i>wall</i> for a sign of perfidy. The humans are cunning.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Exceptional. The brains <i>and</i> the brawn. So far, you’re shaping to be
    a prime example of evolution, <i>weaponized.</i> I will locate the monitor
    room, and erase every camera that witnesses our crimes. Take this, all of
    you.” Aamon tossed three different earpieces to each mercenary. “With it,
    you may speak to me and <b>only</b> me. If you wish to converse among each
    other, <i>I</i> will pass the message.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
Dimitri brushed off the wrinkles of his unbuttoned casual wear.    <i>“Nobody, </i>you start at the bottom. I’ll begin checkin’ the top.
    Anything gets in your way, <i>chop their head off.</i> And use the bloody
    neck-hole as a spittoon, for good measure.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “There’ll be no decapitations today. My beloved is to stay sheathed.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Suit yourself. Now, <i>Herald!</i> You’re the weakest of the four of us,
    and the <i>least</i> wanted by law enforcement. Do you know what that
    means?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Uh. I-I get to leave?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m going to have you stationed outside, preppy! Make sure no one gets in!
    If they try, <i>blow their brains out!” </i>Dimitri dragged his thumb
    across his neck, breathing into Herald’s face. The small faunus became
    flustered almost immediately.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-I’ll try!” As a pushover, Herald showed no insubordination, picking up a
    rifle from his incapacitated lackeys. Everyone filed into the lift one at a
    time, and the first stop was high above, where Aamon would gain access to
    the main computers.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>

    “Hello. How may I help you?” The invisible assistant who acted as chauffeur
    asked. Their message, which came from an unseen speaker, had all the
    percussion of Aamon’s voice, but none of the malevolence.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The <i>‘Monitor Room.’”</i> He answered.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It seems that area is restricted for authorized personnel only. If that
    applies to you, could you please place your scroll on the terminal to
    verify your identity?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Aamon replied by screwing off a panel in the corner with his pointed
fingers, and tampering with the intricate motherboards.    <i>“And… We go up.” </i>But they didn’t. Instead, they descended. “What is
    this?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
Somebody called the elevator. Another member of the Old Fang. Or rather, an    <i>ex-traitor. </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“S-Sanzio!?”</i>
    Herald recognized him. Now, Aamon’s voice had a true competitor. “But
    you’re supposed to be dead!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Quite the contrary. My deceit has revealed to me the horrors of the <i>Administrator,</i> and has brought me to a higher state of    <i>living.</i> I have reformed, I assure you. And I am here to solidify my
    place among the Old Fang. What needs to be done?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Again, a faunus. Why would the White Fang need another representative?    <i>Don’t</i> disgrace me with lies.” Nobody pulled him close to study him.
    Sanzio conceded their shared gaze first.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“To be frank, this is another opportunity to gain the respect of Herald,    <i>and</i> you. I will follow your command. Just… Don’t kill me.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “For now, you’re not expendable <i>yet.</i> Don’t get in my way, and we
    have a deal. Move.” He pushed Sanzio to the back, making sure he had sight
    of <i>everyone’s</i> hands. The ride upward was more than awkward. It was
    <i>
        dangerous.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Sanzio. Take this device. It’ll allow you to communicate with me. Don’t
    waste it.” Aamon sulked into a maze of microchips, where the walls were
    formed by mainframes. Next to disappear was Dimitri on the top floor, who
    parted ways with a giggling wave goodbye. Nobody followed only to slip
    inside a deep metal shaft meant to hold air at a set temperature. Thus only
    Herald, who stood at Sanzio’s waist, resided.

</p>

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    When it came to anything but combat, Nobody wasn’t very patient. Time was
    limited, and as such he bolted through the inner workings of the complex.
    His eye as sharp as his sword, he would’ve spotted the Relic if he ever
    came within contact. The search was both brisk and thorough. What stood out
    most was the irregular pattern of ducts and pipes, which suggested more
    than <i>one</i> floor hidden from public view.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Enjoying yourself?” Nobody remarked at Sanzio, once again waiting inside
    the aerial tramway.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “In a matter of sorts, I am.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “There is evidence of a room below us. If you want to make yourself useful,
    check it out. Do you like <i>life,</i> my dear?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-I guess I have to say yes.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Then if you want to keep it, get to work.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-I know the floor in question. I’ve been here many times, actually. But
    before we do <i>that,</i> I want you to tell me your name.” Sanzio made
    himself clear.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>

</p>
<p>
    The Grimm Tactician laughed at this attempt to seem imposing. “My
    allegiance does not lie with Faunus. Nor will it ever. Become a Delphic,
    then come talk to me.” At that moment, the doors shut and the CCT-Tower’s
    auditor returned.

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “A name borrowed from a <i>friend,</i> much like this scroll. Pay no
    attention to it. What you should be concerned with is the Chronicle of
    Memoirs. Very few can ever lay claim to its secrets. It holds a computer
system with information compiled throughout Remnant’s documented history.    <i>That</i> is the mystery you’re on the bridge of discovering. Why don’t
    we, <i>if it’s alright with you,</i> take a look?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Of course. But you go first. I don’t want anyone behind me.” Nobody stood
    with his back against the wall, the gates sweeping aside so he could
    witness an auditorium of screens. Each held the time on them, every second
    ticking by silently. At the far end, Sanzio presented a <i>blank</i>
    computer. The clicking of a noisy keyboard allowed him entry.

<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So. Say<i> ‘Chronicle’</i> and then ask a question.” Sanzio took a seat,
    much less alarmed than one would expect.
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Chronicle!</i>
    Where are the <b>Relics?”</b> Nobody barked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“That’s not going to work.”</i>
    Sanzio sighed, the inflection of irritation unmistakable.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Unable to commence the search. Classified.”</i>
    The Chronicle ceased all hope of finding the relics. Even this stash of
    history either had elements of its knowledge missing, or locked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Explain. How do you use this?” Nobody probed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Pose a question. Or several. It’ll sort through its files and use your
    words to single in on something. So if it’s information you desire, it
    doesn’t get much better than this.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“So… Other than Relics, or items of a similar nature, I can figure out    <b>anything</b> using this<i> Chronicle of Memoirs?” </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s the idea.” Sanzio nodded.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…” Nobody paused. In his next question, Sanzio detected a lingering sliver
of woeful yet alien despondency.    <i>“Chronicle? Where is a girl named Sophie?”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“You can’t ask that. This system doesn’t accept names. If you want to find    <i>‘Sophie,’</i> then you need to throw out her attributes. Does she, by
    any chance, ever wear armor? And a cape?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Chronicle. I’m looking for someone with armor, and a cape.” Nobody
    admitted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Narrowing the search.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Does she share your love of swords?” Sanzio led him along.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Indeed. Chronicle! I want somebody with unrivaled finesse in swordplay.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>

    </p>
</p>
<p>

<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Sanzio crossed his fingers, putting one leg over the other. Under his mask,
    he was tempted to yawn. “And she’s a <b>Delphic.</b> I’m sure that’ll cut
    down the pool of participants.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“How did you know she was a Delphic?”</i>
    Nobody’s voice reverted to its cold and calculating equilibrium.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Lucky guess.”

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Chronicle. Show me only Delphics.”

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “The search is complete. Thank you for using the Chronicle of Memoirs,
        Mister Urbino.”
    </i>
    A name flashed onto the screen. Nobody leaned back, exhaling through his
    nose, taken aback.
    <i>
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>“Enoch.”</i></b>
    Sanzio read, before trying to hide laughter. He then questioned its origins
    in a joking fashion. “That means Sophie’s either gone, or the Chronicle is
masking her existence. With that, you wouldn’t happen to know who    <i>Enoch</i> is, would you?
    <i>
        Haha!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nobody closed his eyes, taking a deep breath, before opening them again. “I
    recall. There was <i>once</i> somebody by that name. He was everything the
    profile fits- bright, masterful in combat.
    <i>
        Fair and forgiving.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Is he?</i>
    Well, what happened to him?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I executed him.” He revealed amidst an almost playful, ignorant shrug.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nobody’s ear buzzed, and Aamon began preaching. “I’ve replaced all footage
    of you, or anyone, with looped inactivity from approximately twelve hours
    ago. I’ve also scanned the database, and I discovered the floorplans. Deep
below ground, there is a chamber sanctioned from the public. Aamon    <i>‘AA0001’</i> believes it may hold the Relic.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Then all is not lost. What am I to do?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Join me in the elevator, and I will bring us to the <b>real</b> bottom

    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The goal was met, and soon one member of the three factions were loitering
    in the capsule, at the bottom floor. “Herald is still waiting outside. That
    should give me plenty of time to find this vault. First, we need to examine
    its altitude.” Aamon elaborated.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How do you think you’ll manage <i>that,</i> my dear?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “With tenacity.” <i>He plucked out his eyeball,</i> and slipped it through
    the machinery he himself had already exposed. His elongated, metal optic
    nerve was pulled further and further out, never disconnecting. Somehow
    Aamon was able to <i>lower his eye</i> into the <b>deepest</b> catacombs of
    the CCT-Tower, through the elevator shaft.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“…Found it.”</i>
    Aamon tampered with more wires, then fixed the gaping hole in which he
    previously created to bypass security. He sacrificed half his sight.
    Suddenly Nobody, Sanzio, and Aamon plummeted to a knee-breaking halt. And
once entrance into cellar became a possibility, it was time to <i>feast.</i> Something <i>this</i> well-hidden, Nobody knew, granted    <b>power</b> upon discovery. Dusty, stale air signified inactivity.

    “An immense wealth of resources and time have been spent in trying to crack
    the code of these Relics. In the face of the Moth, Supreme Leader Caligula
    has ordered a scholar to dedicate his efforts towards the
    nature of Remnant’s history. His name is <i>Horace.</i> That flood of
    research goes straight to <i>me.”</i> Aamon was first to walk forward.
After all, if he was stabbed through the back, he could always come back    <i>later.</i> That luxury did not extend to Sanzio nor Nobody. “I am not
    kept in the dark on these matters, Nobody. I <i>know</i> Grimm can detect
    the Relic. So I ask you. Do you sense it?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You didn’t research <i>enough.”</i> Nobody pulled Aamon around and
    snatched him up by the chest. “Delphics are <i>not</i> Grimm. I have an
    aura, and if that’s possible, I have a <i>soul.</i> You are <b>nothing</b>
    but junkyard scraps and flesh lost among a sea of clones, always in the
    shadow of the <i>True</i> Aamon.<i> Know your place!” </i>

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nobody nearly broke the cyborg’s neck with his slinging, but he had the
    wits to heed Aamon’s warning. He didn’t die. A reconciliation was needed
    within the ghastly catacombs of Vale while a dreaded chain of misfortunes
    would lead everyone else to the
    <i>

    Herald tried to act as inconspicuous as possible in response to one of
    Beacon’s brightest examples, who was well on her way inside the CCT-Tower.
    No surprise. This landmark was the greatest compilation of information in
    Sanus. <i>Zara</i> would not forfeit the investigation of Servus Portum.

<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Th-The White Fang stole from us! At least, our namesake. They’re far too
    aggressive! They’re asking for all the battles they get! But <b>we</b> were
    here first! At one time, we were all the faunus had. And then, our
    mistreatment, mostly from Servus Portum, caused a splinter-group to rebel
    from us! That group is the White Fang. And they now <i>vastly</i> outnumber

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yes. Err, it wasn’t <i>just</i> Servus Portum’s crimes. But they played a
    great deal in it. M-Me, my Lord, and my men are all that’s <i>left</i> of

<p>
    “Then why are you here? To <i>negotiate? Negotiate</i> me to the top
    floor.” Zara pushed him aside
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No! I cannot allow you! Th-There’s <i>construction! Wet paint!</i> You
    need a license!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Dimitri ruffled through a rubbish bin. He had high hopes the relic was
    there, but all he found was a tossed sandwich. “Argh. Son of a… Eh.
    Honestly not even that bad.” He was stopped from wharfing down this feast
    as a result of Zara’s intervention. She, with Herald, toured onto the
scene. “Well, well! Herald! Didn’t tell me you were swinging with    <i>faunus</i> girls!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Who’s this fruitcake?” Zara mused at Herald.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Hey!</i>
    Name’s <i>Dimitri!</i> And who might <b>you</b> be, darling?” She was
    repulsed at his efforts to kiss her hand.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“This is Zara. I-I couldn’t stop her from coming up! Please don’t hurt me    <i>too</i> much!” Herald kneeled, overcome with fear.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“What’re you blathering about, <i>fool?</i> It’s about time we pulled a    <i>lady</i> into this heist!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Heist?</i>
    You mean to tell me you were hiding some whack job who was trying to pull
    one over the <i>CCT-Tower? </i>Could you reach any higher for the stars?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Sure. I could reach for <i>you,</i> sweetie!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ew, gross!” Zara swatted him away. “Sorry, but It’s my duty as a resident
    of Beacon to apprehend people like you, and bring them to justice! You’re
    going to have to come with me.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Aha, another hero! I’ll have to take note of you, missy. I have my eyes on another young lady from Beacon whom I long to rebuild into the perfect apprentice- my servant, on Remnant! She has promise. But should she fail, I could always return to you. I <i>could</i> do that. Or, I could <i>butcher</i> you, <i>skin</i> you,
    and use your hair as a rug. <i>Your choice!”</i> He wrangled his crowbar
    out of his shorts.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No! No violence!” Herald, in a strange turn of events, found the courage
    to guard Zara. Allies were easily lost, it seemed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Step out of the ring, and sit down like a <i>good</i> little boy before I
    muzzle you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Dimitri proved himself the most formidable of fighters in the past. He had
    the cockiness fit for that title. That only made Zara more rash, especially
    once she’d been put on her back without landing a single hit. And Herald
    wasn’t even close to useless. He was far worse, somehow distracting her
    with his constant squeals and snorts.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yo.” Dimitri activated his line to the expert, Aamon. “Some faunus girl up
    here with hooks. Mind sending the cleanup crew?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “I will be there myself, momentarily. Don’t do a <b>thing</b> until
        that happens.”
    </i>
    He immediately recognized Zara’s presence from description alone. He
    couldn’t wait, lest any harm meet her.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Magnificent. Don’t keep us waiting, <i>Aamon.</i> Show’s already over.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Aamon?”</i>
    Zara gasped. <b>“He’s</b> here, too?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well, yeah. What, you know <i>him?</i> Ha. You get around, don’t you?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “More than I’d like.” Zara admitted. Now balanced on her feet again, the
    clarification of Aamon’s disembark into Vale had her condemning another
    melee. Everything blindly fixed itself in place when he trampled towards
    her in person, the sheen of his skin an affront to any primeval blessing.
    That was
    <i>
        quick.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Everybody, freeze.” Aamon followed his own advice. “Zara. Dimitri is not
    your enemy today. Do not alert the authorities. He is after the same thing
    I am, which will help <i>you.</i> The Relic inside Vale.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Relics? You mean those chess pieces we received at initiation? There’s
    tons of those back at Beacon Academy.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No. Those toys are just that: <i>toys.</i> What we need are powerful
    ornaments of a time more <i>erased</i> than forgotten. Older than you, and
    older than I. Their purpose, I cannot anticipate. But everything I know
    points to them being pivotal to the campaign, or <i>prevention</i> thereof,
    concerning Remnant. There is a woman named <b>Salem.”</b> Aamon’s joints
    beneath the face plating jittered even as his eye was long gone. “She wants
    the Relics. She is manipulating Supreme Leader Caligula as well-”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
Dimitri, who’d reached beyond his boundaries and swiped away Herald’s    <i>blaster</i> when nobody was watching, eviscerated Aamon with a bullet to
    the scalp.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
Herald activated his semblance and floated flat on the floor, disgusted.    <i>“Argh!”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Dimitri! What is <i>wrong</i> with you!?” Zara wiped an oil spurt off her
    stomach.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Augustus has a binder chockfull with buzzwords like <i>‘Bipolar Three’</i>
and <i>‘Tranquilizer Schedule Administered’</i> or    <i>‘Violent Tendencies’</i> just for that question. Hahaha! But seriously,
    he was about to tattle. Can’t have that, can we?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So you <b>murdered</b> him!?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Yeah. These things are a dime-a-dozen. Their scrap sells a good price!
    Sometimes, I use their bodies as scarecrows.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Scarecrows? No, that’s the <i>other</i> freak… Damn.” Zara tried to spot
    any portion of the room not stained with pistons or guts. “Every time I see
    this guy, he gets his head blown off.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Herald reached for his weapon, only to turn stone-cold, sick in the face of
    the gun’s barrel. He wasn’t alone in recognizing the insanity complimentary
    of Dimitri. “Once I’m done here, I was thinkin’ a trip to the zoo. Yeah! I
    wanna go to the zoo with the <i>most</i> animals!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Really.” Zara soaked in the absurdity of her predicament. “The zoo with
    the most animals. Where’s that?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Anima?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “This is a waste of my time. I was hoping to look into Servus Portum using
    a <i>computer.</i> But forget that- Aamon is a gift. He’s a living textbook
    who wouldn’t lie, and now look. <i>He’s dead!”</i> She booted the remains,
    almost slipping on Aamon’s prosthetic blood in an outburst of frustration.
    “Thanks!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You wanna join him? Keep it up, champ.” The microphone was detached from
    Aamon’s cheek. Now, <i>Dimitri</i> was in control. “Nobody. Relic’s not
    here.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nobody!? He’s here, too? Like, the Delphic guy with the sword?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Shhh!” He answered in harsh whispers. <i>“Nobody! </i>Where you at? <i>Delphic!</i> Respond! Is there a Delphic in the house? Paging    <i>‘Doctor Delphic!’</i>” A period of silence commenced. “My guess? He
    either found the Relic and split, or he didn’t and gave up. And I’d say
    that’s a pretty smart skit. If <i>we</i> can’t find the Relic here, than
    Salem stands no chance. <i>Toodles!”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So you’re just going to leave? Who’s going to clean this up?” Zara
    protested.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“You.</i>
    Unless you want to take a vacation down to Augustus Correctional for
    infiltrating the CCT-Tower! Just leave me out of your story, as recompense
    for my letting you live. And who knows, I’d love another date sometime!” He
    winked before the elevator sealed him away for good.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Zara looked down at Herald. “Everyone thinks Aamon’s a bad guy, anyway. I
    could just pretend he attacked me. Keep the story running about how Victor
    wants me dead. Hey, we could blame <i>him</i> for all the other weird
    things Dimitri and Nobody did! No one would ever suspect
    <i>
        you.”

        </p>
    </i>

    </p>

<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’ll call Augustus then. Here’s the story. Aamon showed up alone and went
    on some sort of rampage. But I’m not waiting to paint him as a scapegoat.
    You’d better scram,

        now.”

    His slick, light steps didn’t distract her from dialing the asylum. Now,
    she was the only individual who still waited in Vale’s seismic pillar, all
    others on the verge of disappearance or missing entirely. Nobody never
    received any transmission from Dimitri because he, with Sanzio, had removed
    the earpieces.

    “That vault stored <b>nothing.”</b> He lamented, dragging himself down the
steps without the usual grace or dignity he was known to flaunt. “The Moth    <i>still</i> beckons. Tonight couldn’t have been a more costly sink of time
    or resources.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Admit it.” Sanzio followed him through the damp streets, their trajectory
    suggesting a trip into Summit’s Blight. “There’s no doubting your resolve
to do away with this Moth. But that’s not the only reason you came here.    <i>Sophie.</i> Whoever you were looking for, you were hoping this would be
    the answer. Abandon this path. She’s gone.”

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>“No.”</i></b>
    A still holstered sword was now balanced on Sanzio’s shoulder.
    <i>
        “You are not fit to refer to her by name. Speak once more, you die. And
        I will <b>never</b> let the past go. If I encounter you again, I won’t

    Beacon Academy was never severely affected by the loss of Team Lance or
Blazer. In truth, for now, they were little more than a footnote in    <i>one</i> classroom, amidst an ever-growing outpour of students. But
    without them, their <i>rivals</i> were allowed to run rampant.

    Lucifer leaned both his arms on a tree. It’s lively, wet leaves were
    exclusive to the Meridian. He could not take in the dying caws of birds, as
    something tragically drew his attention.
    <i>
        Footsteps.

    “Alecto. Don’t sneak up on me like that.”

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What? Don’t you trust me?” In her hand, a shaved shard of bark was being
    carved with a finger.
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…I’m just glad you’re finally making a map. It’s about time we switched
    gears. Getting out of here is what we <i>should’ve</i> been working on this
    entire time, instead of squabbling like children. What do you have so far?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Actually, I’m just using this to cover more ground, and find Beleth.”
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer grabbed her arm, causing her to miss and scratch a giant tear in
    the wood. <i>“What?</i> And here I’d thought you’d finally regained your
    senses. Enough of these <i>games!</i> Give up your hunt for Beleth. This

    <i>“Weakness?”</i>
    Lucifer tried not to yell. From behind him, Nadia popped into view. With
    her came an extra mouth to pester the Keraseer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “A-Alecto. Please, listen to him. We can’t continue like this. If things
    don’t change, we’ll never return to Vale. The dance is in three days. You
    can stop this.” She beseeched. “If you apologize, I know Team Blazer will
    forget everything that’s happened.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Apologize!?</i>
    Hahaha!” Alecto belittled these attempt to break through. “Saying sorry to
    a Delphic? The thought, it’s hysterical! Grow up.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto threw her arm forward to shove Nadia away. Lucifer wouldn’t let that
    happen.
    <b><i>“What are you doing!?”</i></b>
    <i> </i>
    He didn’t parry the violation as much as he <i>absorbed</i> it. “You’re not
    acting yourself! Snap out of it! Why are you doing this? Why are you so
    fascinated with <i>pushing away your own friends?!”</i>

    When matched against each other, their pride only ever brought destruction.
    Alecto snapped her sketches in two and now had her sword aimed at Lucifer’s
    chest.

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    In his words awaited an incontrovertible amount of shock.
    <i>
        “You would dare strike me down? Even after everything we’ve been
        though!?”

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “N-No! I would never hurt my friends!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nadia stepped between them, pulling Alecto’s cutlass down. “Beleth was once
    your friend.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re wrong. He was never a friend.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“That’s not true!”</i>
    Somewhat mystified, Alecto had the rare opportunity to see Nadia angry. Not
    sad, or evasive, but <i>irate. </i>“You <i>promised</i> me the night I
    returned to you that there would be no more secrets! You <i>promised!</i>
    What is it about Beleth being a Delphic that’s done this to you?
    <i>
        Tell the truth.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…I can’t.” Alecto backed away. “I-I can’t do it. Don’t ask again.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I thought you were my teammate.” Lucifer shook his head.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-I am!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Then what about when Lexy threw me through a wall? Twice! And who came to
    my side? Had it not been for <i>Boreas,</i> I would’ve drowned! What would
you do? Who would take care of <i>Selene?</i>    <b><i>Do you not care about me at all!?” </i></b>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Selene rose through a field of raised grass. “L-Lucifer? Is everything
    okay?” All eyes were on her. Then, Alecto sprinted away without another
    word. Unlike <i>Nadia’s</i> episode earlier in the year, she met no
    resistance in this action.
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“…Ugh.</i>
    Why does she have to make me like this? Does she think I enjoy it?” Lucifer
    undid his mask, and held his head in his hands.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “This can’t be any easier on her. Whatever she’s hiding, it must be big.”
    Nadia consoled him. “I hope she went somewhere safe.”

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “She went back to that crone, Eleanor. All <i>she</i> does is stoke the
    fires.”

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “L-Lucifer, wait! Where are you going?” Selene, with Merlin’s help, managed
    to cut in front of him.

    “I need to confront Eleanor. She took your tiara. I will not have her crime
    go unpunished. We <i>have </i>to take it back.”

    “What’s so important about it? If you don’t mind my asking.” Nadia said.
    “Isn’t the Rhinestone a greater priority?”

    “…You never know. Remember initiation? The culmination of our work was
    upheld by <i>that</i> tiara. It could be a powerful weapon. After all, what
    else could best Grover?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t know if I believe that.” She lowered her hood over her face. “I
    have a confession to make.
    The tiara didn’t destroy Grover, even if it did blind all of us. <b>I</b>
    took him out- or at the very least, forced him to retreat. I wasn’t just
    present for the end. I was <i>always</i> there. During that flash of light,
    I used the strongest venom I had.”

    <p>

    “…So it <i>was</i> you.” Lucifer smiled. “But that blinding effect was
    still from Selene’s tiara. I’ll tell you <i>all</i> about it as soon as I
    have it back.”

<p>
    <p>

<p>
    “Really? You will? C-Can I help?” Selene feared she already knew the
    answer. Her suspicions were correct when Lucifer gave a simple nod back and
    forth. With that, they parted ways. He journeyed deeper into Terra Insanire
    while his compatriots covered the flanks.

    North of Terra Insanire reigned Summit’s Blight. Even further past that,
    dismissing the hell that was Servus Portum, a faunus waited in a peninsula
    seemingly cut straight from the Meridian and airlifted here. The land bared
the swaying of waves far below. As did Nomad. Around the sign of    <i>Zenith,</i> past the bridge, and through the baroque doors he moped,
    into the modest mansion.

    “Kalthus? You took back the Rhinestone. Why give it away to begin with?” He
    asked. Ahead, behind a wall of static sheets and transparent radars, he saw
    what he’d come for:
