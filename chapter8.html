<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ah, Mister
Virtus and Miss Keraseer! How lucky for us all, that I find myself greeting you
two at the Cross <i>Continental Transmit Tower.</i> What business brings you <i>here</i>
to begin with?” A member of Beacon Staff intercepted his students near the
entrance to the grand monument in question. A glowing mid-day sun contrasted
against the tall tower as a majestic backdrop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Professor
Stam!?” Alecto hissed through the slits of her helmet. “Er, we were just, um-“ </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We were simply
passing through to research Vale, and the surrounding villages.” Lucifer spoke
for them both. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Aha, I’d
gathered that much on my own, Mister Virtus. I’m asking your reasons why!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Should
we tell him? If he finds out she’s been absent all this time, she might get in
trouble. Plus, it’s probably bad news if he finds out Selene and Boreas are gonna
to go snooping around the library.”</i> Alecto pulled Lucifer aside, murmuring
to make sure they couldn’t be heard. She overlooked the fact that Stam was
merely three feet away, and <i>anyone</i> in that position could still hear
her. Lucifer looked over at the Professor, understanding this trivial mistake,
then spilled the beans directly to him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hm. Rather,
the brief secrets between teammates should stay secrets! Especially for ones of
<i>your</i> stature.” He bowed. Lucifer appeared completely unaffected by the
compliment while his counterpart couldn’t hide the flattery in her posture. “I
do hope you weren’t expecting any action inside the CCT-Tower. Otherwise, I
don’t see why you’d bring your weapons. You <i>do</i> know we have lockers for
that, yes?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“They don’t
reach outside the Kingdom- ah!” Alecto caught herself after it was too late. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It’s no
problem, Miss Keraseer! I’d be ill-mannered to control what my students do
outside the confinements of Beacon Academy. As far as I’m concerned, a journey away
these walls means extra training. Don’t let me stop you.” Stam chuckled, softly
pacing away. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I think we
fooled him.” Alecto gave a thumbs up. All she was rewarded with was a sneer and
leave of absence. Before the door closed, Alecto ran through to join Lucifer. “She
still isn’t responding to her scroll, you know. Should I try again? Do you
think we’ll get any service?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We’re <i>literally
inside</i> the CCT-Tower and you’re asking about service, are you out of your
mind?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I don’t
know, I’m still new to this scroll thing!” She followed him through an
auditorium of which the most noteworthy structure was a metal pillar in the
middle, one laced with holographic monitors. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You’ve had
it for <i>how</i> long now? And you’re still unfamiliar with it.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ugh, not
everyone was raised in the technological center of mankind, okay? You may have
gotten a comfortable life from a family snuggled in a well off town, but don’t
assume the same applies to me.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You
disparage assumptions while making up your own. You don’t know the half of it.”
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Tell me
about it, then. You’re pretty familiar with the Cross Continental Transmit Centers,
huh? Is it possible for them to ever go down?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It <i>was</i>
Atlas that invented the system, to the ungrateful arms of the rest of Remnant. It
would take an army or two, or <i>three</i> to take down this tower, even if
it’s dwarfed by the one in Atlas. I don’t see that happening anytime soon, I’m
sorry to say.” He thought himself a fool for even considering the thought, now meandering
in an elevator. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’m not
complaining. What floor do we go to?” Alecto pointed at where she thought the
buttons would be. Only a series of scanners awaited.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hello.
Welcome to the CCT. How may I help you?” A female’s voice spoke over the
speakers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh, cool!
Do we go down, or up?” She cheered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We’re <i>on</i>
the lowest floor<i>,</i> imbecile. What, do you want to go <i>lower?</i> How
about the secret dungeon?” Lucifer chided. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We have a <i>secret
dungeon?</i> Is there’s like a <i>‘secret dungeon’ </i>option, and if so, how
is the <i>secret dungeon </i>a <b>secret?” </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                                                                                                                                                                              </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I was
joking. Please explain to me the long winded, convoluted reason why there’d be
a secret dungeon in Vale’s CCT-Tower?” He noticed a batch of civilians waited
in front of the elevator, not quite on board with sharing the elevator with two
bickering opposites of war. On one side the ideal paradigm of military prowess,
on the other a horned cavalier cloaked in shining armor. Needless to say,
Lucifer moved things along. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Take us to
the <i>Chronicle of Memoirs.'”</i> He demanded.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It seems
that area is restricted for authorized personnel only. If that applies to you,
could you please place your scroll on the terminal to verify your identity?”
The semi-monotone script continued. Lucifer didn’t hesitate to comply.
“Perfect. Thank you, Mister Virtus.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Wow. How
many people get to claim they’re authorized personnel? <i>None.</i> So you’re
top dog around <i>here,</i> too... I’m pretty sure I’m like four seconds from
unleashing calamity on your pretentious, <i>holier-than-thou</i> attitude. I
can’t wait to berate you whenever we discuss kingdom lore, religion, or the Old
Arts.” Alecto droned on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Huh. <i>‘Kingdom
lore.’</i> I’ll give you that one. <i>Religion- </i>Another term for <b>fiction.</b>
As if that matters.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Quite the
contrary. It’s foolish to deny the impact legends and heroes can have on those
devoted. Why did <i>you</i> decide to be a huntsman? I bet you were inspired by
someone, right?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Classified.”
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What?” She
didn’t quite catch his response. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Classified.
I cannot tell. Sorry. As for the <i>Old Arts,</i> feel free to do what I could
not. Explain why <i>you’re</i> here, or at the very least what these <i>‘Old Arts’
</i>are.” The door opened, revealing a large, dim, and full coliseum. The room
was stocked full of computer tiers, each one astonishingly powerful. Lucifer
and Alecto surveyed the rows, taking a considerable amount of time to reach the
end. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“The Old
Arts- not to be confused with the Old <i>Fang,</i> are considered by those who
practice it to not only be a method of combat, not a way of life, but a state
of being. You’ve already seen it, believe or not. Every time you’ve seen me
fight, I’ve demonstrated skillful techniques that respect the Old Arts. Even
against you. But I’m nowhere near perfect.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You don’t
have to tell <i>me.”</i> Lucifer took a jab at her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hey! You
make it very difficult to adhere to the Arts, as a lady I’m supposed to <i>‘hold
thy tongue’</i> and <i>‘turn thou other cheek.’</i> I haven’t done a very good
job of that, have I? Fortunately, the nature of the Old Arts is to learn. We <i>must</i>
work at it.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We’re the
same in that respect, then. Enough, we’re here.” Lucifer sat down at the last
machine and began vigorously typing. After receiving an error and not being allowed
into the system, he held his scroll up to the display. <i>Bingo.</i> He was in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“How did you
do that?” Alecto was first impressed with his keyboard speed, hardly being able
to type at all herself, then his ability to bypass the precautions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“If you’re
the right person, they let you right in. I’m allowed.” Lucifer payed little
attention to her, focused on manipulating the interface with a few more scroll
confirmations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Why are <i>you</i>
the right person?” She asked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Classified.”
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Welcome
to the Chronicle of Memoirs, Virtus. What do you wish to know?” </i>A digital
assistant distinctly different than the one in the elevator spat out
instructions. It was uncanny. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Make sure
you keep this between us, understood? I <b>am</b> allowed here, but it’s best I
use the Chronicle as sparingly as possible. It leaves a trail of what we ask, and
it catalogues our misadventures.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I get it.
So, now we’re going to ask this voice where Nadia is, and it’ll magically have
the answer?” Alecto still didn’t fathom the plan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Not quite.
If we have a lead, we might be able to track something down through specific
questions. The <i>CCTS</i> has an extensive record of everything if you know
where to look, it’s just a matter of recognizing the system’s dynamics.

many attempts to erase itself from the Chronicle of Memoirs, a reprieve was
granted. This single reference of the Covenant would be its only trace in the

further discourse, they left the Chronicle of Memoirs and the Cross Continental

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ella.”

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh, you

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I don’t

of Remnant’s Most Wanted. <i>Dimitri,</i> as he was known. His tracking device
was impenetrable- a pinnacle of Atlesian engineering, and yet we find ourselves
<i>here.”</i> Augustus tossed the wrist guard to Lucifer. It was sliced down
the middle, and whatever was responsible was no doubt leagues beyond anything
Atlas could provide. “The tracker recorded everything. Hit play.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“A <b><i>Delphic!?”</i></b>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What?

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“His sword

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It might

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It seems

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Fine. I

about the Delphics. I need you two to destroy Dimitri’s tracking device. And… Truth

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>There had
never been as much silence in the dwelling as there was right then. Everyone
dropped their heads in despair. Lucifer looked at Alecto and nodded. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Okay, we’ll

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We’re going

hand over her mouth. Now was as good a time as any to collect one of Nadia’s
vestments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“What!? Really?</i>
I-I really don’t think that’s a good idea. You shouldn’t do it.” Augustus rubbed
the back of his neck, suddenly nervous. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Why not?

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I don’t. It

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We’ve
already been to most of them, and I’ve got a feeling this’ll be a keeper. We
should have left already anyway. I look forward to our next meeting! Bye!”
Alecto set precedent by leaving in a brisk fashion. Augustus didn’t have a
chance to say anything else. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yeah, me
too.” He uttered, frowning at the now closed door. Still hovering a foot off
the ground, the twinkling vapor constituting his lower half began to envelop
him completely. Apparently another perk of his semblance was the ability to
teleport, as when the smoke cleared there was nothing left. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The
coordinates from their studies was only slightly further than Summit’s Blight,
but was distinguished by being in a completely different direction. All the
numbers led to was a smooth but cracked dam, no doubt the result of a perfectly
formed cliff. But the height of it, and the empty courtyard in which it was
slammed into gave the migrants an odd feeling. The blockade stretched across
the entire landscape. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh, look at
that!” Alecto pointed to an area of the barrier tainted with markings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“That’s just
a bunch of random crevices. Don’t be… <i>Wait a second.</i> Alright, I stand
corrected.” Lucifer recalled the symbol of the mask seen in the Chronicle of
Memoirs. From memory alone, he could see how the nine etches in the mountain,
if rearranged, could form the insignia. And then he realized touching them
swapped them based on pressure. <i>So it’s a puzzle?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hmm. How
about this?” She said, joining in by tackling the right side. If they hadn’t
seen the image representing this Covenant, it would have been impossible. Only
with the answer could the obscure hallmark be remade. Failure, success, then
pause was the routine. Copious variations on the method finally allowed them to
line up the pieces. The gravel upon which they stood rumbled, and the bluff
split itself right down the middle, separating the mask into two halves. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The
extremely flamboyant mechanism for entry exposed laid bare a tremendous catwalk
held by embellished pilasters. It took minutes for the pair to brave the
overpass on foot. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Great. Do
you think this is enough? I don’t think grimm of <i>any</i> size could breach
this defense. Talk about overkill. What could the <i>disciple</i> possibly be
expecting?” Lucifer identified a colossal door mounted in their path. It didn’t
take much to pinpoint. Compared to the splintery archaic entrance to the
Anti-Citadel, this one was likely several times taller, and appeared nigh
indestructible. Metal, showered with intricate engravings, and bolted to huge
walls with similar grandiosity- the entrance to this Covenant instantly landed
a spot among the greatest monuments they’d seen so far in Remnant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Wow… So,
how do we approach this?” Alecto looked straight up, observing how the acropolis
was trapped by sheer cliffs, not unlike a broken snow globe. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Let’s try
knocking.” Lucifer advised. Neither felt confident enough to actually approach
the gates, so Alecto picked up a mess of stray rocks and lobbed them at the
entrance. In order to make sure her hits could be heard, she had to put all her
strength into the throws. The booming sound was impossible to miss even in the
depths the hidden bastille. Now it was Lucifer’s turn to gaze upward. He saw a formation
of black silhouette peer over the wall, watch them for an uncomfortable amount
of time, then disappear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The double
doors were pushed open from inside by around twenty identical minions, with
about ten more walking through the newly formed opening. It was clear who was
in charge. Leading the parade was a tall individual wearing opulent robes. The
person pinned by a spiky ceramic mask with a permanent grin, clearly reflective
of the Covenant’s emblem. The most shocking aspect of this stranger, besides
the mask, were his legs. Both the limbs were replaced with lanky, razor sharp
peg-legs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Of all
the places within Remnant, <b>nobody</b> finds this place by accident. And with

floor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“W-We’re

cooperated. The man with the mask settled still for a moment, then turned to recoil.

through stone bridges, hallways, and theatres. No corner of the gray fortress
was unfinished, everything was perfectly carved and organized. And with the
presence of clone-like guards everywhere to be seen, it was clear how much of a
living, complete stronghold the Covenant was. </p>

haven’t told you <i>our</i> names. This is-“ </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Not needed.
Lucifer. And you: Alecto.” Raphael continued on his way as though he hadn’t said
anything concerning. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“How did you
know that!?” Lucifer advanced his way in front of his new accomplice. Every Shrewd
in the area turned on him without a word from their master. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Everything
is okay. And I know everything. That’s why you came here, is it not? Or, would
you like to leave?” </i>He didn’t change his posture, therefore any fear in his
face, whatever it looked like, was hidden behind the mask. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…Just tell
us where our friend is. Then we’ll gladly leave. Her name is Nadia, she always
wore one of these. She left them all before she disembarked.” Lucifer showed
him one of her traditional hoods. Raphael analyzed the piece of clothing
without much thought, eventually finding himself taken aback with the emblem on
the bonnet. “Exquisite. Whoever wore this was a <i>Descendant.” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><br>
“A <i>Descendant?</i> What does that mean?” Lucifer asked. Alecto reached for
the cloak. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Would it
bother you if I kept this? With it, I could do some research and help you find
Nadia. You want to find her, right?” He did a good job guilt-tripping them into
allowing him his desires to keep the article.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Of course.
It’s yours.” She dared not inquest her own loyalty. “Oh, we were wondering, she
was good friends with a man named Augustus.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Really?”</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yep. The
day she left, he sent a crook named Dimitri to Atlas through the Forever Fall
Forest. His tracking device recorded a conversation he had with an outsider
called <i>‘Nobody.’</i> From it, we’ve deduced Dimitri encountered a <b><i>Delphic.”</i></b>
As usual, Alecto spat out the word with intense hate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Delphic?</i>
Do tell.” Raphael giggled, leading them into an amphitheater. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Delphics
are scum, that’s all you need to know. If you see a humanoid with the physique
of a grimm, you’ll know you’ve found one. And apparently Nobody thinks it’s
welcome in Remnant. I don’t really see how, but Augustus suggested this
incident could lead us to Nadia. In their dialogue, it became clear Nobody used
a sword, and described it as <i>‘undoubtable the sharpest in <b>all</b> of
Remnant.’</i>” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Really?”</i>
Raphael froze for a moment. Alecto and Lucifer assumed he had an answer, and
was reveling in the moment of clarity. “…Not a clue, I’m afraid. I do not know
where your friend is. My apologies.”      </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ugh, this
is useless. First the Chronicle has nothing, now <i>you</i> have nothing.”
Alecto whined. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Do what you
will. You can even explore my castle, but only as long you tell me anything you
think might help the search. Anything could help, simply call for me. Don’t go
anywhere you’re not supposed to, the populous will alert me. And I will be there.”
Raphael probed for more information. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’ll look
around, maybe that’ll finally yield answers. It’s clear I’m not going to find
anything from you. Enjoy each other.” Lucifer left. He’d occasionally bump into
a Shrewd, but all things considered he was grateful not to receive their stares
for being so different. Tiberius: Covenant of Dukes was big enough that he
almost begn to think himself lost. There were so many empty churches, forums,
and dining halls that he found himself pondering the possibility of trickery. <i>Could
this castle be alive?</i> It wouldn’t be the first time a foreign region
hoodwinked him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Resigned to
roam around without any purpose, Lucifer eventually encountered a different
scene. A narrowing staircase that lead to a huge vault door, and to say it was <i>guarded</i>
was a gross understatement. There were likely over twenty Shrewds watching the
gateway, each armed with a blade and crossbow. They were all line up along the
walls, encapsulating the stair-well towards the fort. Perhaps it was boredom,
perhaps it was a desire for answers, but Lucifer decided he should infiltrate
the armory. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>There was no
feasible angle for subterfuge as long as Raphael’s men sat prone and
concentrated on security. If he fought them, no doubt Raphael would descend
upon him. <i>Could he <b>fight</b> Raphael? Was it even worth it?</i> “Nadia
could do it…” He groaned in frustration. Getting inside without being seen at
all was the best option. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The Shrewds set
their sights on Lucifer, as he figured the best idea was to crawl down the
shooting gallery under his cape. A couple of the marksmen looked at each other
in bewilderment, then hopped from their podiums to check the red cloth. They
prodded the bundle of cloth a handful of times, waiting while all others
watched until one of them flicked it away with their saber. <i>Nothing. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Lucifer used
this opportunity to slip past the spectators into the mausoleum. He sacrificed
his cape, but it may very well have been a worthy sacrifice. So far, nothing
but the comparatively perplexing architecture peaked his interest. The cobwebs
didn’t help. There were far less torches inside than outside. Numerous flights
of stairs brought him to a circular chamber. Sculpted pillars and a cloudy
atmosphere couldn’t distract from the violet flame in the middle. Some sort of ritualistic
pyre slept in a golden cradle, and its heat could be felt even from a distance.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What kind
of mindless gibberish is this?” He couldn’t believe his eyes. Every corner held
an alter decorated with recently extinguished candles. He swept the dust off a
nearby mural out of ailing curiosity. It depicted four basic figures standing
against a fifth. Inscriptions in an extrinsic language covered the thing, but
one poetic list of words he could read at the very bottom set the tone for the
rest. <i>“Arbiter, Slayer, Blood, Scourge, Spawn.” </i>he read out. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Another one,
chosen at random by Lucifer and requiring him to slog a great distance due to
the enclosures size, illustrated what he could only assume to be the same five
idols standing below a star. Much like before, the only legible text recited
the phrase <i>“First Bewitchment.”</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The
huntsman-in-training turned on the fire. As he drew closer, it’s earthly but
unnatural glow gleamed brighter. Lucifer couldn’t resist reaching for it. The brazen
cinders called to him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Just a few
minutes earlier, when he split up with his partner, she spent her time
conversing with Raphael, hoping she could squeeze more insight out of him. Hesitant
to jump in, however, they walked in silence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I thought
there weren’t any Keraseers left.” He stated. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“W-What do

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>”I recognize

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Fine. Is
that a problem for you?” She stomped her feet, suddenly on the defensive. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“No, no,
nothing like that! Not yet, anyway. And your friend, a Virtus. Some may
consider it an honor to have both a Keraseer and a Virtus in their presence.
I’m exempt from that charm, fortunately. And after all that build up, you two
are here looking for a <i>Descendant.</i> How poetic.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Why do you

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Selene

“<i>Oh, you have. How wonderful, it’s an entire team of liars.” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Y-You don’t

not! How dare you insult a Keraseer! Have at you, then! Let us see who’ll prove

intertwining his fingers, not at all intimidated. But suddenly, before she
rushed forward, his attitude shifted. His head jolted to the side. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><b><i>“The
Sacred Embers!”</i></b> He gasped. Instantly, he broke into a sprint, blazing
through the Covenant of Dukes with speed so swift, Alecto didn’t have a chance
at catching him. Raphael navigated the corridors and gardens perfectly. It
wasn’t long before he found the guarded staircase. The Shrewds made way for him
without needing instructions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Within the
divine passage, Lucifer was entranced by the Sacred Embers, inching his
outstretched fingers toward the flames. Before contact was made, a hand ripped his
own away. It took him a period of confusion to garner back his senses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><b><i>“What
are you trying to do!?”</i></b> Raphael screamed in his face, tugging him away
from the prized suttee. Every one of his grunts funneled into the room after
Alecto, each waiting for a signal to fire. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What is the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Merely the
old antiques of a historian, nothing more, nothing less. And nothing of
interest you two. You should leave, now.” Raphael’s level-headed resolution
convinced Lucifer to trudge outward, past Alecto. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“C’mon. He’s

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“He’s not
going to tell us where Nadia is. What’s the point?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Listen
to him, Alecto. Do as your team leader says, always. Never betray his rule.”</i>
Raphael stood in front of the Sacred Embers, making sure there was no chance of
trespass. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Grr! Your
time will come!” She retreated outside, wherein Vale’s representatives were
overseen by a congregations of Shrewds. Raphael stayed put and walked over to
relight most of the candles with a scorching piece of wood from the fire.
Throughout the journey out of Tiberius: Covenant of Dukes, Alecto consistently
glanced backwards, reaffirming the notion that they were <i>not</i> being
followed. Out the main gates they went, and that was the end of that. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Fantastic.
That didn’t accomplish anything. In fact we lost progress, because now he’s got
one of Nadia’s hoods, my cape, and a bunch of information. A complete waste of
my time.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“That’s <i>our</i>
time, actually.” Alecto replicated the strategy from before, throwing rocks at
Raphael front door, although this time it was out of spite. In the back of her
mind, his words regarding secrecy never left. <i>C-Could they really be hiding
something from me?</i> She then remembered the supposed amount of skeletons
hiding in her own closet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“C’mon. We
shouldn’t waste any more, if it matters that much to you.” Lucifer began the long
trip across the bridge, back to the beloved Academy. While Lucifer had Alecto
accompany him in a search into the deep recesses of Vale hidden from the public
eye, he had tasked a set of equally important allies to do their own research
in Beacon’s library. And with night cascading upon the heroes without a hint of
benevolence, now was the perfect time for such an undertaking. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Our peers
like to use the library as a gathering ground to socialize, play games, or just
loiter around. Therefore I’m not surprised Professor Stam hid his antique tome
collection in the bookshelves. Who would ever look for books in a bookshelf?
It’s laughable! Unless you’re <i>me,</i> of course.” Boreas attended Selene to
the furthermost shelf on the second level and began pulling the books out. He
was right, behind a set of encyclopedias were a stack of withered yellow
writings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Don’t go
too fast, we’ll have to put these back the way we found them. It’s a risk to do

multitude of supposed deities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Huh.

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…Okay then.
Whoever wrote this was being strangely discreet about the purpose of the
relics, however many there may be. That’s what makes it stand out. I was able
to gather that each one was hidden by another unspecified being. I haven’t the
slightest clue of the specifics. Apparently they’re important enough not to
talk about on paper, I’m guessing in the event this falls into the wrong hands…
If you were going to hide something crucially important, you’d put it in
Remnant’s greatest labyrinth. You know what that sounds like?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…Summit’s
Blight?” She theorized. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Exactly.
Maybe the White Fang, or this <i>Nomad</i> is searching for it. It would make
sense, and it would also explain…” He slowly lifted the Beryl Rhinestone.
“W-Wait a minute!? Could this be it?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What, a
relic? No, I-It can’t be. If Nomad was after it, he wouldn’t have given it
away. Not to mention he had… Uh, never mind.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Well, it’s
a great possibility he didn’t know! And if this is in fact the truth, we’ve got
the White Fang cornered!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Um… We can
only hope. It’s not like we can ask anyone about it. Wait! Look!” Selene
clutched another textbook, this one stamped with the same iconic label seen on
Nadia’s clothes. So far her brand was turning out to be a pivotal clue in
finding her. Boreas caught her drift with ease, and held one half of the cover
so they could read together. After a scribbled foreword, which was looked over
with incredible disinterest, they found a good starting point to compile
whichever details seemed relevant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“The Origin
of an Amaryllis.”</i> Boreas recited the first chapter’s name. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Ahem.</i>
What could two promising young minds possible need with an elder’s treasures?”
Somebody tapped Boreas’s shoulder. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“P-Professor
Stam!?”  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Don’t mind
me, Mister Zale. Mind yourself. I don’t think <i>you</i> would appreciate your
old collection being soiled by grasping hands and prying eyes. And you too,
Miss Virtus? Isn’t it past curfew?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Professor,
w-we were just trying to, um-“ Selene failed at rallying any substantial
defense. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It’s no
problem, Miss Virtus. I trust neither of you saw anything too important, yes?
Just the rambled teachings of a seasoned <i>Scribe.</i> Run along now, just
don’t let me catch either of you doing it again.” Stam smiled, watching Boreas
file the fables back into place. His two students whispered to each other in a
rushed fashion, contemplating whether or not to pull a third party into their quest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh, um, Professor?”
Selene made the first move in dashing up beside him. “We’ve been looking
everywhere, trying to find Nadia for quite some time now. She been missing ever
since our fight with Lucifer. And we really miss her. We were just hoping your
books might have a clue as to where she went, or who she was.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Miss Flora
didn’t tell you much about herself, did she?” He stroked his chin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“No… But she
was such a great friend. I really wish things were different. Aha, I guess I
just had this idolized vision of what it would be like in Vale. My fault for
setting expectations so high. I never thought my team would fall apart like
this.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Nonsense,
Miss Virtus. You and your team exemplify not only the standard for this <i>combat</i>
school, but to the other teams. Just look at you and Miss Keraseer. I’d be
hard-pressed to find a more exceptional partnership. And your team leader? I
don’t think I need to explain how admirable the relationship between all four
of you is.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“He’s got a
point, you know. If only my team was as dutiful.” Boreas set a hand on Selene’s
shoulder. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Y-You’re
right. Maybe, if Nadia really is gone for good, we can visit her in Mistral
sometime! I’m sure she’d love to see us again! Even Lucifer! I already can’t
wait to travel away and see the look on her face once I’ve finished training my
semblance! But one thing I’ve been thinking is, if she’s gone, how will Team
Lance continue with only three members?” She sprung out of the gloom of
pessimism. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Don’t
worry, Miss Virtus. I’ll take care of everything.” He put full weight on a
convenient pedestal, stopping at the exit to the library. Boreas and Selene
pranced away without a hitch, back to their dorms were they belonged. <i>“I
have a feeling that moment of rekindled friendship may come sooner than you
think.” </i></p>
