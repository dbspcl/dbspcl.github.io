    Day had finally broke, and with it any chance of sleeping in. The first
    array of classes would determine once and for all whether or not our heroes
    were ready for the challenges ahead. Challenge number <i>one:</i> wake up
    before nine o’clock in the morning. Half of Team Lance had already passed.
    As Selene rose from the westernmost bed, she let out a loud yawn.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Good morning. I trust you slept well?” Lucifer sat idle in a chair
    positioned at the opposite corner.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yep! But I’m not sure <i>he</i> did.” She gave Merlin a hug. “Yesterday
    must have taken a toll on him.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He’ll walk it off. He always does.” The clock, assuming the bearer of bad
news, claimed they only had thirty minutes to prepare. “I guess it falls to <i>me</i> to be the alarm? I haven’t the slightest clue when they’d    <i>like</i> to wake, but I have a feeling I’m about to find out.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Have fun with that!” She retreated to the washroom.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Nadia.</i>
    It’s time to get up.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “H-Huh? Oh. It’s just you.” Nadia opened her eyes to see the tech-toting
    cadet stand before her, his arms crossed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s <i>just</i> me. And it’s also <i>just</i> eighty-thirty. Does that
    work for you?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s fine. Thank you.” She sat up. “It’s not an issue at all, but consider
    greeting early birds with a more <i>friendly </i>face. It’ll brighten their
    day, you know. Just a suggestion, though.” There was always an anxious tint
    to her words, as though she was terrified of saying something wrong.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I see. Let’s give it a try.” Lucifer grabbed ahold of the closet’s handle
    and pulled. <i>“Locked…</i> But how? There wasn’t one yesterday. Hello?” He
    tried again. “Hello?!
    <i>
        Argh.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He slammed his fist on the door a few times. “It’s time to wake up!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Shhh!”</i>
    Nadia seized his attention by tensing up. “Remember: <i>Friendly.” </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Right.”</i>
    He took on a more joyful yet sarcastic persona, flexing his hand a few
    times just to give the door a few light taps. <i>“Wakey, wakey.</i> Hello
    in there, it’s time to wake up!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“What!?</i>
    What do you want!?” Alecto wrenched it open, wearing full armor. He
    contemplated saying something, but wasn’t given the chance. She slammed the
    door back in his face. Lucifer flexed his neck in anger then looked at
    Nadia.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Friendly!”</i>
    She emphasized. He nodded and left the closet without a word. “So, you
    really didn’t mind sleeping on the floor?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Affirmative.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Wait. Is that a yes, you did mind? Or <i>yes,</i> you <i>didn’t?”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Affirmative.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, now I see... Anyway, I bet since you were willing to take one for the
    team, that armor has a lot of cushion. Then again, it would have to,
    considering how much damage you took in that Grover fight. That… That was
    very impressive.” The windows were swept open thanks to her. The morning
    dew smelled pleasant.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You don’t have to remind me.” He sat back down.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’ll keep you on your toes though.” She giggled.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s always a concern when <i>you’re</i> around, isn’t it? I’m not
    complaining, a rogue will fit well on this team.” In the brief moment
    Lucifer had looked away, she was already gone.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So I’m qualified, right?” Nadia finished the vanishing act by blinking up
    next to him.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’ll be perfect for the job.” He nodded.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hya!” Alecto kicked the closet open and swung her sword forth, seemingly
    practicing her technique. Between that and the slamming door, she was
    making a great fuss. That kind of skill, the sort that brimmed with
    passion and fury, was a delight. But it quickly died out. “You know, these
    training rounds just aren’t doing it for me. Not doing it at all. There
    must be <i>some</i> sort of practice area on these grounds.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You could always go outside.” Lucifer pointed at the window.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What, do you want me to jump!?” She stomped the ground.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You can handle the fall, I know you can. I saw it just <i>yesterday.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto went back to sparring <i>nobody</i>, leaping around the middle of
    the room. “Don’t even get me started.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I wouldn’t dare.” He shook his head, bemused. “…And we’re on the top
    floor- all the more reason to swing your sword somewhere else. Otherwise
    we’ll have a load of dog-walkers and faculty at our doorstep… Would you
    stop? You’re making too much noise.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I dare them to come. They’ll understand my plea as soon as they see what
    I’ve got to work with!” To punctuate her confidence, a batch of knocks
    tested the entry-door.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Case in point.” As head of Team Lance, Lucifer opened up to represent his
    partners.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Sorry to intrude.” A complete stranger holding a blanket blocked the
    doorway. “But I’m from the next dorm over, and I’m trying to get some
    sleep. Can you guys keep it down in here?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ah. A <i>faunus.”</i> After a pause, Lucifer looked over at the one
    responsible. “That means it’s for you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Who are you?” Alecto took his place to greet their guest. Whoever it was,
they managed to fit in right amongst the varied chaos of Team Lance.    <i>Sickly skin, flaming eyes</i>, and <i>horns.</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Sorry, I forgot. My name’s <i>Zara.</i> Can you guys just bring the noise
    down a bit?” One could tell by the nature of her voice she was barely
    awake.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Got it. Now go get some sleep.” Alecto closed the door. A wave of
    suspicion overtook Zara, prompting her to stay and gauge their honesty.
    Hardly any time passed before the sounds of mayhem further seeped through
    the walls. She hammered the door harder this time.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Who is it?” Alecto repeated the procedure.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I want you to <i>keep it down.”</i> Zara’s eyes flared up, sending a plume
    of smoke and flames to the ceiling.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “S-Sorry.” Nadia emerged between them. “We’ll be quieter. I hope you sleep
    well.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I might <i>now…”</i> Zara grumbled. Her departure back down the passage
    confirmed they <i>were</i> being more considerate. Although there wasn’t
    much time left till classes would begin at this point. For everyone, even
    these short few minutes passed too quickly, and now they anxiously sat in a
    classroom.
    <p>
    </p>

    The lecture halls of Beacon Academy were large, yes, but it did nothing to
    quell the anxiety of its inhabitants. Nearly all three teams were settled
    in, the professor sitting in a chair with his feet on the desk. Everyone
    waited, watching the clock, while <i>he</i> enjoyed a game on his scroll.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Alright! Welcome, class! My name <i>is…”</i> He rose to scribble two words
on the whiteboard. “Professor Stamatios, but you address me as<i> ‘Professor Stam.’</i> First name: <i>Professor.</i> Last name:    <i>Stam. </i>Now, as you can imagine, I’m going to call your names.<i> </i>
    I may mispronounce them- so I apologize in advance. Like everything, it’s a
    learning experience.”
    <i>
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Disregarding the very end, roll call went by without a hitch.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Zara Haken?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The newcomer entered the room right as he called her, answering while
    sitting down next to her team. She raised her hand. “Here! Oh, um, sorry
    I’m late but I was wondering-“
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nonsense! It’s not late unless you’re here <i>after</i> your name was
    called, Miss Haken. If you think <i>that’s</i> bad, you should have seen me
    on <i>my</i> first day! Actually no, you shouldn’t.” Stam’s voice boomed
    forth, and it didn’t seem like he was even trying. “Now, it seems you have
    a question! Let’s hear it!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-Is this the class for <i>‘Combat Application?’”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No, it’s Aura Education.” Stam pulled her leg. Everybody scrambled to pack
    their things and leave, thinking they were in the wrong place. “W-Wait!
    Stop, I was joking!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    After the wave of panic passed, Stam resumed his lecture. “Now don’t think
    I didn’t notice. None of you have followed <i>Beacon’s Dress Code.</i>
    However… I find your various apparel far more colorful, not to mention
    effective for <i>combat</i>- the focus of this class. I do not know nor
    care about your other instructors but, with Headmaster Ozpin’s permission
    of course, we don’t concern ourselves with uniforms here. If we did, I
    wouldn’t be wearing <i>this.”</i> He gestured to the crossing guard’s vest
    fit over his suit.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Let’s cover the rules!</i>
Be respectful. Alright, rules <i>done.</i> I’m not about talk, I’m about    <i>action.</i> So ditch the formalities, we will not improve by waiting.
The staff here at Beacon Academy are preparing you for combat out on the    <i>field.</i> So in this class, we go to the <i>field.”</i> The mood
    immediately improved. “When we aren’t sparring, we’re out on field trips as
    we are today. Our journey will take us to <b><i>Summit’s Blight. </i></b>I
    could tell you the nature of it, but instead I think it’ll be far more
    effective if you all see it for yourself, unhindered.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    In no time at all, the new professor had sorted his students onto the first
    available bullhead and shipped them away into the unforgiving cliffs
    resting to the east. Summit’s Blight stretched in all directions, a vast
    collection of gloomy peaks with no end. From the inside, there appeared to
    be no true exit. Remnant smiled on the trespassers this day, sparing them
    from the endless rain- though the thunder persisted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Alright students! Here’s a hardy welcome to Summit’s Blight.” Professor
    Stam strolled in front of the airship, the teams standing at ease. “This
    place is infested. You must be careful. As we go lower the weaker Grimm
will thin out in favor of stronger ones, but you’re still welcome to    <i>cautiously</i> venture down there.” Alecto’s hand rose into the air.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Is that extra credit?” She asked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well Miss Keraseer, keep in mind your assignment is merely to hone your
    skills in the wild. Taking on tougher Grimm will reward you in the form of
    greater experience! I only ask that you try!” Even though he shot down her
hopes, he was <i>almost</i> enthusiastic enough to make up for it.    <i>Almost.</i> Next, Nadia offered a question.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Um, sorry, but what happens if we get lost, or we’re in trouble? I-I’ll
    try not to be a bother…”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We’ll be fine, there’s no way those-“ Alecto started.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Brilliant question!” Professor Stam probably didn’t even hear himself talk
    over her. “There’s one thing you must remember. When your time within
    Beacon is over, you will stand on your <i>own.</i> I won’t be there to help
    you. Why start now? You won’t learn from <i>me</i> solving all your
    problems. So although I will <i>generally</i> refrain from fighting on your
    behalf, I will periodically check up on each of you. If you truly are in a
    compromising situation, simply yell.
    <i>
        I will be there.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He assigned each team a direction, eventually coming to Lucifer and his
    band of allies. “Ah yes, Mister <i>Virtus.</i> It’s a pleasure to have you
in my class. Although it’s a tad uncharted, you are to explore the    <i>northern front.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I understand.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Actually, Mister Virtus…” Professor Stam stroked his beard. “Come to think
    of it, your team is <i>more</i> than capable...” He then garnered the
    attention of <i>another</i> team waltzing away. “Miss Haken!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yes?” Zara herself returned.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’ve come to a realization. There should be <i>somebody</i> to guard the
    airship in our absence. So while the rest of you are busy out there
    accumulating the spoils of combat, these two will stay <i>here</i> and
    learn <i>patience.”</i> He gestured to a certain member of Team Lance.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “M-Me?” Selene squawked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What!?” Lucifer failed to contain this outburst. “But can’t <i>you</i>
    stay and watch?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I can watch you, or I can watch the Bullhead. But I’m afraid as much as
    I’d like to, I cannot do both.” He crossed his arms, everyone else filing
    away.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “But doesn’t she need the combat experience?” He tried again.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t worry, this’ll hardly be a rare occurrence. Her time will come.” By
    the tone of his voice it was clear he wasn’t going to budge. Before further
    dissent could voice itself, he was already gone.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If you need anything, signal me. Right away, alright?” Lucifer threw
    himself between the ship’s two new guardians.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “O-Okay.” She nodded.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He turned his attention to Zara, able to effortlessly spook her with one
    hollow statement. “Keep her safe.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Team Lance, with the exception of their youngest member, set off into the
    depths of Summit’s Blight. Not all was bad, though. Some crackling thunder
    was happy to greet them with open arms. The trio danced down a rocky trail
    without much problem, save for the occasion Grimm fodder and playful
    bickering. It was hard to tell which one was worse.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Maybe you can start coming <i>here</i> to train.” Lucifer remarked.
    “Plenty of targets for you to fight.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Unfortunately <i>you</i> aren’t one of them.” Alecto laughed. “Besides,
    you seem perfect for this place. Gray on gray.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well if that’s all it takes, then we’re <i>both</i> misplaced.” One more
    step and they reached a massive crater. A huge wooden gate could be seen at
    the bottom, presumably leading deep into the mountain. Even without it, the
    nearby plaque and carved staircase downward proved whatever this location
    was, it wasn’t made by
    <i>
        Grimm.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Anti-Citadel.”</i>
    Nadia read out engravings on the stone sign. “I-I don’t know what that
    means.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How about we go find out?” Alecto said. In response, an eerily loud
screech vibrated the mountains, so blaringly outrageous in volume that even    <i>Alecto</i> began to question her own suggestion.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You heard that, right?” Nadia looked around, suddenly paranoid.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m having trouble hearing at all, now.” Alecto said. “What <i>was</i>
    that?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “A Grimm.” Lucifer stated the obvious, looking back where he’d come. The
    look of concern was indistinguishable through his mask. Turning his
    attention back forward revealed to him his slow pace, the other two
    fighters already hiking down into the clutches of the
    <i>
        Anti-Citadel.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The crows above never stopped circling nor cawing. But their presence grew
    less noticeable the further down one went, appearing only as cloud
    imperfections once the bottom had been met. As their size shrunk, the
    direful gate’s size inflated.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “W-We can’t go in <i>there!”</i> Nadia pointed at the scarily primitive
    door.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Dark, dank, plus I’ve got a terrible feeling about it.” Alecto nodded.
    “All the more reason to suspect there’s Grimm inside.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The paladin took charge, pulling the double-door open. Even when squinting
    and raising the face-plate of her horned helm, she couldn’t see very far
    inside.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Huh. Hey!” Alecto called to Lucifer. He wasn’t paying attention. “What are
    we supposed to do now?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He walked up beside her. His willingness to foolishly look through the
    emptiness brought similar results. To an outsider it appeared as though his
    eyes switched off, blinking out for half a second just to return. Only this
    time, they were <i>green</i> rather than orange.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What do you have in mind?” Nadia knew he was up to something.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Night-vision.” He outlined his entire way of thinking with a simple
    phrase. Perhaps part of that plan was almost completely losing himself to
    the darkness before his teammates caught up with him.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hold up, speedy!” Alecto put both her hands on his shoulders. “I don’t
    have <i>‘night vision!’</i> What are <i>we</i> supposed to do!?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hold on as you are now. We have no choice to keep moving.” He resumed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ugh. This is insane.” She did as told, though she didn’t have to be happy
    about it. Nadia completed the train by holding onto the crusader’s
    shoulders. Metal and soft footsteps were the only auditory guide provided.
    At a certain point, Nadia felt is appropriate to lighten the mood with some
    humming.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Hmm, hm- hmm! Hm hmmmm!”</i>
    She shook her head back forth, almost dancing with her steps. But even with
    the uplifting tune, Grimm were perceptive enough to detect them. Creeps
    weren’t particularly dangerous, but considering the lack of vision it
    wasn’t a <i>great</i> situation. At the slightest sound of treachery,
    Alecto leaped away and drew her sword. Even if offense wasn’t an option in
    the dark, blanket defense could stall.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Wait for my call!” The role of strategist fell to Lucifer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What does <i>that</i> mean!?” Alecto didn’t inspire much confidence.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Just attack when I tell you!” The reverb of brutal combat could be heard,
    Alecto grateful most of the weight had been lifted from her shoulders but
    disappointed she couldn’t participate herself. As for Nadia, the assassin
    was out of sight and mind, using <i>sound</i> to migrate around the
    battlefield and bring a swift end to her adversaries. One four-needle stab
    was all it took for Grimm of <i>this</i> nature. The only evidence Lucifer
    was still there was his lucent pupils.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Now!” Once it became too much, Lucifer tossed a batch in front of Alecto.
    Springing into action, she was able to create a semi-sufficient picture of
her foes from the way her short sword cleft through them.    <i>“Behind you!”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Falling solely on his word, she swooped around and swung with precision
    despite the shrouding effect at play. It worked. Chunks of Grimm were lost
    to the fog.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That was the last of them.” Lucifer said. Nadia let out a sigh of relief
    and revealed herself.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Was it now? Okay, not bad.” Alecto sheathed her blade and reached forward
    for Lucifer’s shoulders, Nadia doing the same. Now that they were back on a
    straight shot down the makeshift subway, it wasn’t long before a lone light
    reminded half the gang that they <i>weren’t</i> inherently blind.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Finally! I can see!” Alecto ran forward. The lamp gave her the lay of the
    land. Ever since they’d passed the great entrance, all that presented
    itself was a colossal mine dug into Summit’s Blight- a gigantic hole cut
    deep into the mountain. It continued even still, but at least now daylight
    was within reach. After such a tremendous channel, the door on the other
    side was almost underwhelming. A simple oak gateway with a bulky wooden
    frame was their reward. Behind it rested more caverns. But while the three
heroes were exploring the depths below, another quest was brewing far    <i>above.</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Following further conversation between Selene and Zara, an intense bellow
    tamed the heavens- the exact same roar that spiked fear into their friends.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I really wish my friend Merlin was with me. He wasn’t feeling well today,
    but <i>he</i> could’ve protected us.” Selene and Zara sat on the floor of
    the bullhead with their legs hanging off.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We don’t need protecting. We can fight!” Zara swung one of her hooks
    around.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Woah! Can I see?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ha. Sure.” She handed one over. “They’re like exaggerated fish hooks. And
    check this out.” Having already given her <i>left</i> sickle-like weapon
    away, she pulled out her <i>right</i> duplicate. The hook used red dust to
    heat up until flames slipped off of the red-hot metal. Zara appeared immune
    to the blistering effects.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s <b>so</b> cool! I… I wish I had something like that.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well what do <i>you</i> fight with?” They returned onto Zara’s back with
    ease.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-I can’t really do it right now.” Selene sheepishly admitted. “I can try,
    though.” She hopped off the aircraft and closed her eyes, concentrating.
    But nothing came forth. “Sorry.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“I’m sure I’ll get to see it, eventually. Even if your team caused me to    <i>almost</i> be late, we’ll probably be seeing a lot of each other. I
    mean, our dorms <i>are</i> right next to one another.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, sorry about that! I guess they can get sort of loud sometimes.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Honestly my own team isn’t much better.” Zara stroked her own hair. “That
    reminds me, who <i>was</i> that with you? The one with armor.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Which one with armor?” Selene snickered.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The guy with red eyes? He’s got, like, <i>smoke</i> coming out of his
    helmet?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh! That’s Lucifer! And it’s actually not smoke, it’s mist. He-“ Selene’s
    eyes lit up, but the sound of rabid footsteps halted any chance of a quirky
    story. Remembering their purpose for being here in the first place, Zara
    was hesitant but willing to investigate.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Around a large formation of boulders they witnessed an ominous figure. The
    drifter was facing away from them, mere inches from the edge of a cliff,
    intently glaring at the one segment of the sky where sun penetrated the
    clouds. A coat, emblazoned with arcane symbols, remained strapped to his
    shoulders, forever catching the wind.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    To say it was an unnerving sight would be putting it lightly.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “H-Hello?” Zara broke the silence, not knowing whether or not the stranger
    knew their presence. He turned his head.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>“…Your Aura?”</i></b>
    His eyes widened.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Y-Yeah? What about it?” She asked. Selene hid behind her.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“It’s the same as… It’s not important. What are you two doing here?”</i>
    His antlers couldn’t be missed, even as he turned around to fully face
    them. They stuck high into the air.
    <i>
        “It’s dangerous to roam these mountains. There’s too many Grimm. It’s
        no place for children. You should leave.”
    </i>
    The faunus’s appearance conveyed evil intent, with his eyes curving
    downward. But his voice, if sinister, seemed more curious than anything.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We’re here from Beacon Academy, and it’s up to us to keep the area clear
    of enemies, even if they aren’t <i>Grimm.”</i> Zara clarified, becoming
    oddly suspicious. She armed herself.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>“Beacon Academy?”</i></b>
    His eyes were stuck on her hooks.
    <b>
        <i>
            “…Then I am merely an ally.”
            <p>
            </p>
        </i>
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I have no allies here.” Zara shook her head. The deer paused, then let out
    a laugh. It sounded more genuine than threatening.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “For anyone else, that might be true. But you’re right about one thing.
        This place isn’t safe.”
    </i>
    His smile was already faint to begin with, but it completely faded as he
    gazed back at the sun. Setting his sights back on Zara alerted him to a
    lurking Beowolf.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The wanderer whipped out an archaic crossbow and fired before the good duo
    could react. The bolt zipped past them and impaled the creature, killing it
    instantly.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…O-Okay. Fine, you’re an <i>ally.”</i> Though late, Zara now realized the
    nuance of the situation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Yes, indeed. Now, let’s get you out of here.”</i>
    He left the bluff to retrace their steps.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What!? But the bullhead! It was right here!” She was right. Although she
    couldn’t have moved more than fifty feet away and around a stack of ore,
    the same path back brought a <i>completely</i> different environment.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>“You’re lost.”</i></b>
    The coat-wearing rover looked around.
    <i>
        “And without a ship, anyone who enters this place will meet the same
        fate. Follow me.”
    </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Lost?” Selene gasped. “How did we get lost? That doesn’t make any sense!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Perhaps. Summit’s Blight is not the place for lone travelers. Your
        knowledge, any combat experience, everything you know about Remnant- it
        means nothing here.”
    </i>
    In the wake of his rant the group paced forward in silence.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Zara!” Selene uttered. “Are you sure we should follow this guy? We don’t
    even know who he is!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I know, but I think he might know how to find the bullhead. Do you think
    we should leave him? I mean, you’re kind of right. He doesn’t really have
    anything to gain by helping us.” She crouched down and spoke in breathless
    whispers, making sure their conversation remained private.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “You will not find your ship without my help. And although you do not
        know me, I have my reasons.”
    </i>
    He interrupted, still stalking forward.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Okay. What are they?” Zara, although not completely open to this alliance,
    figured conversation might change her mind.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “One day, perhaps in the next life, you may well find out.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Well how about we start with something simple? What’s your name?” Selene
    pitched in.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Hmph. Meaningless conjecture.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Well… You’re just roaming around here, so how about <i>Nomad?</i> That’s a    <i>‘roamy’ </i>sort of name!” Selene suggested.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “I suppose I won’t stop you. Now, a question of my own. How did you
        find me?”
    </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We heard footsteps. You weren’t being very discreet.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Footsteps? I hadn’t moved from that spot since sunrise.”</i>
    <i>Nomad</i>
    came to a halt. He looked around, studying the area. Of all the avenues to
take, they never anticipated he would approach the nearby deep trench.    <i>“Over here. It appears we’re at an impasse.” </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah, I noticed.” Zara sarcastically remarked. Nomad glanced at her whilst
    Selene peeked into the canyon.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That looks like a long fall…” She deplored. He looked forward, past the
    dilapidated stretch of hills into the distance. A somber expression broke
    through for but a moment, but it was hastily suppressed. He shook his head.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“We cannot go around, only over. This ravine is deep, not wide.”</i>
    Without even trying, Nomad crossed the gap by means of leaping. It was
    almost unnatural how effortlessly he flew across, with the way his jacket
    never left his shoulders.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Alright, my turn.” Zara twirled her hooks around and threw them across,
    aiming for a rocky peninsula above. “<i>Success!</i> Selene, hold on.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “O-Okay…” She reluctantly accepted her hand. “You know what you’re doing,
    right?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You couldn’t be in better hands!” They swung across with no problem.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Your skill with that weapon, rare as it may be, is admirable.”</i>
    Nomad was far from impressed, but there was nothing to complain about
    <i>
        yet.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Thanks?” Zara dusted her knees off. Ahead, a wheel locked a rather large
    door. Zara tried to pull it down, but it wouldn’t budge in the slightest.
    It might as well have been <i>attached</i> to the hatch for all the
    progress she made.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Grimm will come.”</i>
    Nomad, captivated, cranked it, forcing the quarry-bound opening to pivot
    down. He wasn’t having much trouble. To him, it seemed a mere
    inconvenience.
    <i>
        “Do not hesitate to kill them.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    As predicted a batch of new enemies crawled onto the mountainside. The
    otherworldly ally was unconcerned, not even looking back. Selene stumbled
    behind Zara, who herself primed the hooks.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    While they certainly presented a challenge, they would need greater numbers
    to pose any real threat to Zara. <i>Selene,</i> however, had little to
    defend herself. Through the duel Zara was able to protect her, but at a
    certain point, a larger Beowolf scooped the dual wielder up. Now out of
    position and grappling with a slobbering villain, she was unable to guard
    Selene. A death sentence.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Ah!</i>
    H-Help me!” The princess was cornered, although she made the smart decision
    to fall over into Nomad’s peripheral vision. He looked over, yawning at the
    crank that none other could shift, and tossed her his crossbow. Selene
    was in too much of a rush to appreciate the intricate engravings or genius
    engineering, more concerned with figuring out how to even <i>fire</i>.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Despite fumbling with it, she had seen Lucifer fight enough to know one
    thing: <i>pull the trigger.</i> It worked, and she had the Beowolf’s
    animalistic nature to thank. It ran her down, almost practically in front
    of her, so she couldn’t miss.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“If we don’t move, we’ll never get out of here.” </i>
    Nomad gently pulled her to her feet. He was pleased to see Zara return in
    line with his command.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, um, thanks. This is yours.” Selene held the repeater up with both
    hands. He retrieved it. This new location would have been easily
    recognizable if either of the teenagers had been there before. Selene, and
    to a lesser extent Zara, had to watch their footing as a thin stone bridge
    connected two adjacent cliffs.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Now was the worst time for the iconic roaring to return. The floor on which
    they stood riveted back and forth, and another round of frantic shrieking
    echoed throughout Summit’s Blight. Neither of Beacon’s representatives had
    experienced anything like it save for the <i>first</i> time they’d heard
    it, at the bullhead. “What keeps doing that?” Selene asked. Nomad had the
    answers.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>“The Grand Gatekeeper</i></b>
    <i>
        is a massive Grimm plaguing Summit’s Blight, a horrible hybrid beast
        with six legs. Try not to dwell on it.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You mean like a spider?” Zara shivered.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“In appearance perhaps, but not in practice. Leave it be.”</i>
    Once they’d reached the other side, Nomad stopped them.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What is it?” Zara questioned the leader. The area’s physical description
    seemed to hold great value to him.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Nothing. Over here.”</i>
    The direction he chose appeared completely arbitrary despite his great
    deliberation. Time would tell whether or not it would yield results. Even
    if it didn’t though, it <i>did</i> bring a great view.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Wooow.</i>
    We’re really high up.” Selene’s eyes shimmered. Zara sighed as well, taking
    it in, both of them jogging past the cloaked foreigner towards the ledge.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“We’re nowhere near the top, nor are we trying to be.”</i>
    Nomad hinted at an even better peak and view. But he was about as
    interested in that one as he was <i>this</i> one. The crossbow was pointed
    far into the sky and ignited, a bolt zooming through the air. The navigator
    almost missed the spectacle, but it was clear to see. The bolt faded out of
    existence before it even reached the clouds. Crossing his arms and studying
    his unlikely alliance, he noticed Selene’s tiara-
    <i>
        golden vines holding up a darkened gem. <b>“How peculiar...”</b>
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Higher and higher the party traveled under the watchful eye of Nomad,
    meanwhile their <i>associates</i> were doing the opposite, charging deep
    into Remnant.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re still here right?” Alecto couldn’t tell if Nadia’s presence was
    lost due to her semblance or the lack of light. The torch helped out but
    those standing on its cramped outskirts didn’t receive full benefits.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yes! S-Sorry if I made you worry.” Her words bounced around the damp
    passage. “I-I’ve always wanted to do this. N-Now that we’re alone, I
    finally have the chance. <i>Timber!”</i> She shouted. Her words returned
    soon after.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re having too much fun.” Lucifer mixed a snort and laugh together.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh. Sorry...”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“I’m</i>
    just wondering where all the Grimm are. Who knows, maybe they’ll turn up
    past here.” Alecto made an educated guess. She was half right. Tiptoeing
    past the splintery archway and around the corner brought them face to face
    with a truly intimidating entity.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, Team Lance! Glad to see you’ve made it this far!” Their <i>teacher</i>
    congratulated them.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “P-Professor Stam?” The crew voiced their unease in unison. He sat in a
    foldable chair, reading a magazine under the light of his scroll,
    surrounded by teeming caves and ruined masts.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t mind me- just dropping in after checking everyone’s progress to
    survey your own! You’re doing great!” If anything could attract more Grimm,
    it would be Stam and his enthusiastic yelling. He was never out of breath.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I thought there was only one route here, the one we took.” Lucifer noted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re probably right! Was it the one with the big door?” They nodded. “Ah
    yes, I remember my first time at the <i>Anti-Citadel!</i> I was but a young
    lad just beginning- actually, that’s another story for another time! I have
    my work cut out for me, as you have yours.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, um, Professor Stam?” Nadia kept him from running off. “We’ve been
    killing the occasional Grimm, but there’s been much less than we were
    expecting. W-We’re not doing anything wrong, right? I’m sorry if we’re not
    performing to par…”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nonsense! Maybe someone else is thinning the herd!” Stam thought out loud.
“Tell you what, if you can show initiative by finding out who,    <i>that’ll</i> be extra credit!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Quick! Let’s go!” Alecto grabbed Nadia’s wrist and pulled her past
    Lucifer, in a rush for the bonus points.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Hahaha!” </i>
    Stam rested his arms on his chest, spitting out a guttural laugh.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Killing Grimm <i>and</i> getting rewarded for it? I think this might be
    her dream come true.” Lucifer added in one more jab at the knight. “I
    should probably go with them.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s the spirit!” Stam let him do just that.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Gah!” Alecto’s excitement was met with a <i>literal</i> smack in the face.
    A rogue cloth was carried by the breeze into her path of destruction. The
    sheet muffled a string of obscenities up until she ripped it away. Her
    temptation to threaten whoever was responsible was replaced with
    apprehension upon further inspection. It couldn’t be mistaken for anything
    else- the red symbol was neon on white fabric. <i>“W-What?”</i> Her voice
    told a story of surprise and confusion.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“A White Fang Flag!?</i>
    In the middle of a <i>cave?”</i> Lucifer seethed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Huh. Do you think <i>they’re</i> killing the Grimm?” Nadia searched the
    surroundings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Would this ‘White Fang’ have any reason to?” Alecto finished the
    bombardment of questions, handing the flag to her team leader for
    investigation.

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Well if they’re down here, they won’t be up there, where our    <i>bullhead</i> waits.” Lucifer crumpled it up and threw it in the corner.
    “Let’s make it our mission to keep it that way.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “But aren’t we supposed to stay on track and slay Grimm?” Alecto raised her
    sword, conflicted on whether or not she was welcome to the idea.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You wanted extra credit? Now’s your chance.” Lucifer dismissed her.
    Another incessant scream rumbled the inner mountain, following them
wherever they went. Most likely a result of the so-called    <i>Grand Gatekeeper.</i> Grimm never came, their numbers completely flat-lined despite
    the constant drop in altitude. But now that a wild card had been thrown
    into the mix, Team Lance was on high alert.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’ve never fought the <i>White Fang</i> before. I’m well versed in what’s
    called the <i>Old Fang,</i> but this seems completely different. What are
    they like?” Alecto huffed out through her headgear. Nadia piped up this
    time.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, I-I actually know a lot about this. They’re a rag-tag alliance that’s
    branched away from a peaceful organization founded upon the back of an old
    deity<i>.</i> Their organization is dedicated to the prosperity of faunus-”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Negative.</i>
    The White Fang is a radical brigade, abusing guerrilla tactics to take
    whatever they want, from <i>whoever</i> they want.” Lucifer sneered.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well… Well that’s a <i>side</i> of it, I-I guess.” Nadia frowned.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s the <i>only</i> side as far as I’m concerned. Either way, we’re on
    the <i>right</i> one.” He retorted. They’d soon arrive at a hole. It was a
    steep slope with loose granite chunks lining every inch. Lucifer slid down
    it without a second thought, landing even further below the surface- or so
    he thought. Alecto didn’t question his brashness, and went on to do the
    same.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We’re… above ground?” Lucifer was at a loss for words. Even though a rocky
    roof kept the light away, the walls were broken away to display endless
stretches of gray pyramids watching from the distant horizon. “What    <i>is</i> this place? Something’s gone wrong.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Guys! Um, I can’t go down!” Nadia was missing the conundrum, locked above.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Why not?” Alecto struggled to see her.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-I can’t dirty my robes… To do so is the height of disrespect…”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Jump! I’ll catch you!” Her plan was simple. Nadia wasn’t fearful by any
    means, and accepted the challenge. “There you go, princess!” She set her
    down.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If I’m the princess, what does that make Selene?” Nadia joked. Fortunately
    for her, Lucifer was tuned out.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Shh! Listen!”</i>
    He shut them up. Frantic shouting whirled in their direction. Whoever it
    was, their voice was scrawny, shrill, and feeble. His words couldn’t be
    made out. “If only we had somebody to recon the area…” All eyes fell on
    Nadia.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “M-Me? Okay...” She dissolved. “I’ll be right back.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So do we wait for her signal?” Alecto tapped Lucifer’s shoulder. “Won’t
    that give her position away?” He contemplated her words, then groaned.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nadia hummed to herself, prancing forward, clearly hidden from any
    witnesses. The strange yelling persisted as she roamed the terrain, but it
    didn’t last. Her inner singing petered out until her thoughts drifted back
    to Lucifer’s scolding words of the White Fang. She sighed. Then, the very
    topic of her daydreaming arrived.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Ack!”</i>
    Somebody ran into her. He must have been outrageously sly to have
    out-camouflaged <i>Nadia</i> without even trying, and with no invisibility
    either. <i>“Wh-who are you!?”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nadia’s concentration had been impaired, leaving her open to prying eyes.
    The little person before her was dressed in an exotic mantle. So frail was he that he didn’t even
    match her stature.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“O-Oops! I’m- uh<i>, nobody!</i> I’m just here on a morning jog, Mister,    <i>err…”</i> She saw on his chest a patch was stitched. The name tag held a
series of somewhat decipherable symbols that vaguely resembled the word    <i>Herald.</i> “…Herald!” Due to the lack of a better alternative, the name
    would have to stick for now.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Eck!</i>
    A-A jog!? In Summit’s Blight? Are you sure?” <i>Herald</i> hissed. A
    reptilian tail swiveled between his legs.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hya!” Alecto zoomed past her ally in a flash, now behind Herald with her
    sword around his throat. Sharp chokeholds seemed to be a favorite of hers.
    “Quick Nadia, run! I’ve got him!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Alecto!?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Egh!” Herald squealed and squirmed out of her grasp with such ease, it
    actually <i>confused</i> her. <i>Did she see right? </i>Herald turned thin
    as <i>paper</i>, took on the appearance of a <i>sticker,</i> and slipped
    through her legs.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How in the!?” She swung at nothing at all, like swatting at an especially
    agile fly. Using the gusts of her onslaught, the paper-mate blew towards
    the exit.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Wicked intruders!” Herald returned to standard physical form. He
    positioned himself in the frame of a makeshift door next to his hidden
    henchmen. “Stop right there!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    His two cohorts ran past him to subdue the seditionists. Nadia noted
    something peculiar about them- they weren’t like standard White Fang
    grunts. Their uniforms were slightly different, differentiated by
    four-faced masks, not to mention their weaponry lied outside the norm. Each
    held what could only be described as a pike-on-a-stick. Whatever it was,
    stabbing- and <i>only</i> stabbing- was its application. Nadia did her best
    magician’s impression and left the scene.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Herald’s displeasure at seeing his troops falter to Alecto alone couldn’t
    be masked. He backed away, already scrounging up a backup plan. It was
    rudely interrupted by his <i>third</i> opponent. The soldier dropped in
    from behind and snuck up on the commander with a dagger at the ready.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Die!”</i>
    Lucifer replicated Alecto’s strategy without knowing her failures. Thus
    Herald resumed the repetition. His semblance worked just as well. Alecto
    finished her bout with an arching slash that forced the two foes to bow
    out. She joined Lucifer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Y-You stragglers don’t belong here!” The Estranged General stuttered with
    both his threats and movements, deliberating his next move. He chose a
    straightforward approach: <i>run.</i> Herald was faster, but his haste
    brought him to a very open dead end, cornered at the edge.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hold it right there, Light Fang!” Alecto threatened.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <br/>
    <i>“White</i>
    Fang.” Lucifer rolled his eyes.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Whatever!</i>
    We’ll stop him all the same!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Wait! Eh- No fair! That’s not going to… <b>nghh!”</b></i>
    Herald fumbled finding his words. At the first advances of the barbaric
    insurgents, his semblance triggered on impulse alone.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No! You <i>slime!”</i> Lucifer couldn’t stop the wind from carrying Herald
    far into the clouds, but it wasn’t over- Lucifer was among the few fighters
    who made use of <i>ranged</i> weaponry. His trusty sniper was a great
    choice, but someone stopped him from raising the firearm. “Nadia!?” He
    looked at her in bewilderment.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He’s already gone.” She shook her head and walked away. Lucifer’s
    frustration was visible from his body language, let alone his growling.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We’ll get him next time!” Alecto’s unfamiliarity with the White Fang
    helped her optimism, and as a result she set her team forward. The walls
    were closing in, forming a sort of tube. But what welcomed them on the
    other side would shock them more than Stam, the White Fang, or their
    ever-changing environment. After going further and further down this entire
    time, taking several twists and turns in a non-linear maze downward; just a
    couple meters up for once and they were in the presence of the
    <i>
        bullhead.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…I’m never coming back to this place again.” Lucifer let his head hang
    back. “Wait a minute, where’s Selene!?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    They had somehow circumnavigated to their quest’s origin. But they weren’t
    the only ones doing work to achieve that goal. Selene, Zara, and Nomad had
    crossed even further off the beaten path in much the same manner.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You shouldn’t come back here.” Nomad’s mannerism implied his time with
    them was at an end.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If we get lost again, you can just lend us another hand!” Selene was
    unconvinced.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I won’t be here next time. Don’t come looking for me.” He dammed not to
    even turn and address her directly. But Zara disagreed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t be silly, there’s no way the Grimm will get the better of you. They
    can’t even get the better of me, and-“
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>“Don’t come back!”</i></b>
    He clenched his teeth. <i>“There’s nothing to be found here.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Sheesh, fine.” Zara walked away. He waited for them both, allowing them to
    pass in front of him. A couple steps and she was thrown into the familiar
    courtyard with the aircraft. “Hey, we made it!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nomad’s eyes narrowed on the one visible student: <i>Lucifer. </i>Before
    anyone had a chance to look over and see Nomad, he was already gone. A
    rapid draft was left in his absence.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Huh? Nomad? W-Where did he go?” The zephyr provoked Selene to take
    note his abrupt disappearance. It didn’t matter. Team Lance’s full
    return overshadowed his abandonment.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Selene! You’re okay!” Alecto bounced up and down whilst Lucifer gave her a
    light embrace. Nadia also unveiled her true form, pleased as anyone.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What? Where’s <i>my</i> recognition?” Zara pouted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well to be fair, <i>Nomad</i> did most of the work.” Selene tried to hold
    back her amusement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He did
    <i>
        not!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Who’s this ‘<i>Nomad’ </i>fellow?” Nadia pondered.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He was just here! You should have seen him! He was really tall, he had
    this cool jacket, and he had these big antlers!” Selene built the colleague
    up, rightfully so.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Antlers!?</i>
    He wasn’t in the White Fang, was he?” Lucifer tossed his gaze around,
    always ready for an altercation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The White Fang!? No, no! He was one of the good guys!” Zara stuck up for
    him.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Good</i>
    guys?” Nadia held her arms, her insecurity shining.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Wait, the White Fang is here?” Selene shuddered.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Ugh.”</i>
    Nadia trampled away towards the ship, a look of anger on her face.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Not anymore they aren’t!” Alecto put her hands on her hips. “Extra credit,
    here we come!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Extra credit? You’re telling me you figured out who put a stop to the
    Grimm?” a familiar accent hit the friends hard. <i>Professor Stam.</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He strutted into view with the rest of the teams. At long last, everyone
    was together at the getaway vehicle. Nobody was even sure how long they’d
    been frolicking in the monochrome hillsides, their tour guide included.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The White Fang, if you can believe it.” Lucifer saw him to the airbus.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t know for sure I can<i>… </i>The White Fang?<i> Here?”</i> His
    voice turned rambunctious. “But your conviction is convincing, no surprise
    there, Mister Virtus! I’ll take you for your word!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yes!” Alecto celebrated too soon.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Team Lance will receive one extra point!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Eh, that’s it?” Her disappointing was accompanied by a slouch. Zara and
    Selene tried not to laugh.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Stam finally checked his scroll, the clouds looking a little too dim for
    his liking. “What time is it? Oh, we’ve been here longer than expected.
    Alright everyone, gather around! After getting to see everyone’s fighting
    ability, I must say I am… <i>more</i> than impressed! You lot are filled to
    the brim with potential, I can already tell! What with my supervision, I’ll
have you all conquering Remnant within the year! Are there any questions? <i>No?!</i> Excellent! Come, students! We mustn’t dilly-dally!    <i>Beacon Academy awaits!”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He sorted them all into the bullhead and prepped for a launch. Not a single
    obstacle stood in their way now. Clearly just <i>getting</i> to the ship
    was enough of a task for one day. And what a day it had been.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>Summit’s Blight</i>
    brought with it horrible hailstorms of thunder, deafening hollers from
    mysterious new Grimm, and a labyrinth full of enemies so baffling that the
    only escape seemed to be found with pure luck. But perhaps the most
    puzzling of all it offered was <b><i>Nomad</i></b>. His time in this blight
    was seldom over.
