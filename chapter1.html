<p>
    Lucifer had fallen from the skies and stuck the landing no problem, but now
    he had another issue. He wasn’t the only student having been launched into
    the Emerald Forest, and save for <i>one,</i> a single glance at any of them
    would have ruined everything. Where Selene was, Lucifer hadn’t the
    slightest clue. Despite his best attempts, gauging her through the clouds
    seemed like a poor strategy in practice.
</p>
<p>
    Without consideration for the meadow, he ripped through the raised grass
    towards a cliff face. It was a sight to behold, a walking archetype of war
    raising hell through a picture perfect grassland. At the mountain’s edge,
    Lucifer growled. He raised binoculars to his eyes, taking advantage of the
    high ground. There was nothing to suggest <i>walking</i> would have been
    any more effective in finding Selene.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He saw nothing but the intrusive march of trees. A waste of his time. He
lowered the binoculars in shame, having practically failed already. If only    <i>Ozpin</i> had laid down rules that put more control in the hands in the
    students, and not random chance. Lucifer was left with nothing to do but
    inefficiently scour the emerald expanses.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hmph,” he grunted, turning and nearly running into another student.
    “Fantastic.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hey!” A feminine voice protested from the suit of armor. Lucifer swiftly
    pushing her aside, her complaints irrelevant. “That’s not very charming,
    you know.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>“I’m</i></b>
    not very charming, you know,” Lucifer scoffed. “Not today, anyway.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What, bad teammates already?” she followed after him. A sinister pang
    filled every word, likely due to the armor’s echo. “Initiation <i>just</i>
    started, it can’t be that big of a deal. Name’s <i>Alecto</i>, in case you
    were wondering.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I wasn’t.” He continued jogging down the prairie.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto had the sense not to respond this time, partly out of restraint. Her
    own patience was running thin with her new, <i>supposed</i> teammate. But
    that would need to wait. The duo marched down the glades, deeper into the
    Emerald Forest in complete silence save for the caws of crows circling
    above.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ozpin spoke of a temple filled with relics. The students are likely to
    congregate there. What do you know?” His abrupt orders, if a bit gruff, at
    least put them on track.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto had no chance to speak, a massive bird-like Grimm blocking the sun
    overhead with a screech.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I bet that <i>disgusting</i> creature up there knows the way. Maybe we
    should ask it.” She contemplated snorting at that last statement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “<i>Nevermore.</i> That’s not <i>completely</i> insane, actually.” Lucifer
    looked up to see for himself. “What’s your plan?” He didn’t have any means
    of controlling Grimm, nor garnering their attention. The fact that Alecto
    brought it up at all meant she <i>had</i> to have something up her guarded,
    metallic sleeve.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“I was joking… But it is <i>possible.</i> Even if we agitate that    <i>Grimm,”</i> she said, the contempt evident in her voice. “we’re too low
    down for it to care.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “But find higher ground, and it’ll swoop past.” Lucifer finished her
    speech, already switching tracks, now racing to higher altitude.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s the highest crest in this forest.” The Knight pointed to a peak
    stabbing whatever mists the skies had to offer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “A feat of altitude.” Lucifer nodded. “Move. I won’t be waiting for you if
    you fall behind.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t worry, we’ve <i>both</i> got capes to trip over.” The new
    accomplices continued the harmonious hike, occasionally dealing with small
    Grimm packs. Lucifer was beginning to consider their progress sufficient
    until one herd in particular caught them both off guard. While he generally
dealt with his enemies in the quickest manner possible, with his    <i>fists,</i> the surprise of the two Beowolfs at once forced his hand.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He upgraded to a simple firearm that lashed out in short bursts, so long as
    it held dust casings. The weapon was used more to push the enemies back
    than kill them outright, even if it did do substantial damage.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto watched, disregarded Lucifer’s fighting style, then contributed by
    throwing <i>her</i> weapon: a short sword inscribed with runic symbols. The
    blade soared into the back of a Grimm, doing little more than forcing it on
    its stomach. It needed more. Lucifer obliged, gripping the sword’s handle
    and adding a few more stabs.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Should I bother asking your name?” Alecto sighed, figuring now was as good
    a time as any to ask. She retrieved the saber and joined him alongside a
    deep trench with no way across.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’ll find out sooner or later.” His response was quick. Lucifer’s nasty
    combination of anger and determination pushed him to smash a nearby tree at
    its base. A crackling sound accompanied its decent, where it then collapsed
    downward into a makeshift bridge. Before stepping on, he whipped his head
    forward, motioning Alecto to go first.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What?” Alecto did as she was told despite her distaste. All went well,
    that was until yet another Beowolf lunged from the bushes straight at her.
    She caught it by the jaws, struggling both to keep her balance, and keep
    the creature at bay. Lucifer <i>would</i> have helped, if he wasn’t dealing
    with a similar anomaly himself.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Grah!” A random Boarbatusk used its strong outer armor and heightened
    speed, at least compared to the Beowolf, to blitz Lucifer down from the
    other side of the log. He only had a moment to turn around before the
    spinning stack of power slammed him square in the stomach and sent him
    across the tree, into Alecto.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The two fighters and their adversaries violently tumbled across, albeit to
    the other side of the gorge. Aiming to take out the soldier while he was
    down, the Beowolf was on him in a second, repeatedly slamming with its
    claws in an attempt to breach the high-tech armor.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Die!”</i>
    Lucifer, having finally come to his senses after a few powerful strikes,
    grabbed the animal by its thick neck and hit it in the cheek with a curled
    fist. The power sent it careening into a daze. One wicked swing of the tree
    that had dutifully served as a former foothold, and the entire chunk of
    wood was in pieces, with the Grimm both out of sight and commission.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto hustled to her feet in time to be rushed down, the Boarbatusk
    treating her to the same hospitality it gave her colleague. The collision
    mixed with her retaliation sent the Grimm off the cliff, and left her
    hanging off of a clump of roots, mere inches from failure. It wasn’t going
    to hold long.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Enough games!”</i>
    Lucifer hastily reached down, seized her by the cape, and wrenched her up
    in a rather inhospitable manner.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Hey! You’re to blame! How hard is it to hold your ground against a    <i>Grimm?”</i> She brushed herself free of dust. “You didn’t have to grab
    so hard, either.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The raspy chime of his voice never failed to convey displeasure. “Well,
    you’ll think about it next time.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Think about <i>what?</i> Cleaning up <i>your</i> mistakes?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The Grimm was sent off <i>with</i> you. Hardly a viable-“
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The floor shook with the Nevermore’s roar. They were getting closer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I haven’t the time.” Lucifer resumed his sprint to the top. Despite the
    quickest route requiring traversal of smaller grassy hills, and an indirect
    approach towards the summit, good ground <i>was</i> made.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto acknowledged this fact, grateful that for all the transgressions,
    she hadn’t left Lucifer yet. “We’ve got plenty of breathing room here, you
    know. They’re not going to run out of relics, and even if they did, I bet
    we’re far ahead of the competition.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t care about that.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What <i>do</i> you care about? Why are you at Beacon? It doesn’t even seem
    like you want to be here.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Negative.</i>
    You misquote- I don’t care about the <i>relics.”</i> He never stopped
    moving. “Now, to the relics.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Are you, like, stupid?” She couldn’t help but laugh. He was reluctant to
    let it go. “No, I get it. You’re looking for somebody. Odds are they’re at
    the temple. But why the rush? They’d be with <i>other</i> students. Can’t
    they fight?” <i>No answer.</i> “…Hello?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What?” he grunted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Are you listening to me?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “These are <i>not</i> matters up for discussion.” Lucifer remained
    headstrong.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I see how it is.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A few quips later, and at long last the ridge had been reached. They were
    high above the Emerald Forest now, in the wake of the rather magnificent
    sun. Alecto took in the view, sighing, while Lucifer scanned the horizon.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s right there.” Alecto pointed at the colossal bird. “The one
    terrorizing the skies.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
Lucifer gave a short scowl then reached for his arsenal. A dust-powered    <i>sniper</i> would do well. Not only could he get a clear shot with the
    scope, he could also see the <i>temple-</i> right below the nevermore. He
    was only permitted to fire a few shots.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>“Grimm!”</i></b>
    He swooped around and blocked an incoming pounce <i>with</i> the sniper,
    lurching back to avoid the slobbering bites. It didn’t last long. Lucifer
    drove it back, once again utilizing the gun to <i>shove it, </i>directly
    towards Alecto.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hya!” She ducked the claw swipe and skewered her enemy through the
    stomach. It writhed in pain before fading to dust. “Huh, you actually saw
    that coming. If only you were as perceptive to your <i>allies</i> as you
    are your <i>enemies.”</i> She signaled him to return the elongated knife,
    still lodged in the rock.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Only <i>one</i> can harm me.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I wouldn’t be too sure,” Alecto hissed. “I don’t know who you wanted as a
    teammate, but it would probably do you well to ratchet down the bravado.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It helps me concentrate.” Lucifer retrieved the sword and tossed it back
to her. “And it would probably do <i>you</i> well to pick a    <i>different weapon.</i> Not a very practical choice.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Don’t</i>
    mock my weaponry. It has more meaning than a gun.” She took a combative
    attitude. “You’re too cold to understand.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Stop talking.”</i>
    She stopped him dead in his tracks.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Don’t</i>
    tell me what to do. All you’ve done this entire time is complain, and push
me aside every time I try to work with you. I’m sick of the unearned    <i>holier-than-thou </i>attitude! Enough!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer turned and inched towards her. <i>“Watch your tone.”</i> He spoke
    stern.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Your facade doesn’t scare me.”</i>
    Alecto was completely open to a confrontation at this point, meeting him
    head-on.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Trust me, there’s <i>plenty</i> more to fear.” Lucifer followed suit, the
    two now standing eye to eye, sizing each other up. Even if Lucifer did have
    a height advantage, he was still challenging an armor-clad knight that, so
    far, showed impressive fighting skill. “But a <i>hag</i> with a sword isn’t
    one of them.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“How <b>dare</b> you insult a Keraseer!” </i>
    That was the final straw. She charged.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The two clashed, but Lucifer’s reactive fighting style gave him an edge.
    Even though he blocked practically every strike, he couldn’t land one of
    his own. The short skirmish brought both to the steep ledge of an overhang.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Argh!” Lucifer finally slipped up, receiving a brutal blow to his mask
    with her hilt. Enraged, he had nothing but a desire for payback, and
    perhaps to his detriment, he took the fight <i>down.</i> Alecto was pulled
    with him, off of the bluffs, into a very open abyss.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    An unlikely ally came to their rescue. Lucifer could pat himself on the
    back <i>later</i> for firing upon the nevermore when he did. Now, the
    unwelcome evil broke their fall.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Metal mail and body armor met bird as the impact took a toll on all three.
    Lucifer landed at an angle hard, his bearings unclear. Grasping whatever
    feathers she could find, Alecto had it better, considering her new
    challenger took a majority of the impact.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The would-be Huntsmen crawled to his feet atop the soaring monstrosity and
    ran at Alecto just in time for his punch to be parried. What followed was a
    back and forth bout as each combatant tried to one-up the other. Alecto was
    first to make a mistake, putting power over precision.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “You’ve ruined everything! And for <b>what!?</b> Does your hollow honor
        blind you so?!”
    </i>
    Lucifer’s weaved past, managing a wicked shot at her shining veil. His next
    barrage sent her, and by extension himself, ebbing onto the sail-like arm.
    Not too much of an issue, all things considered, until the Nevermore
    started <i>flapping.</i> He lost his grip on her and was tossed
    to the opposite wing, bordering the rim.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“You’ll <b>not</b> make a mockery of me!”</i>
    Alecto followed soon after, using her momentum to fly through the air with
    the intention of slamming down her sword right on top of a very vulnerable,
    flustered Lucifer. Her attack did some good damage, but it forced him
    reeling off of the wing, and once again he <i>wasn’t</i> going to fall
    alone. Lucifer used one hand to latch onto the last feather and another to
    rip her down by her cloak. Thus Alecto dropped headlong over him,
    descending to the surface far below.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Never!”</i>
    He seethed, relishing his victory.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“You <b>coward!”</b></i>
    Alecto’s claws tore through <i>his</i> cape, bunching it up so she could
    cling to the fabric and keep herself in the fight. Lucifer couldn’t focus
    on pulling himself up while <i>she</i> was holding him down.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“No… No!”</i>
    His grip was slipping. <i>“I-I have no choice!”</i> In a last ditch effort,
    he unlatched the medals holding his cape. Alecto fell, still clinging to
    his wrap, slipping through the air until she was indistinguishable from the
    green labyrinth waiting on the surface.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer hauled himself up and trudged to the middle of the nevermore in as
    quick a manner as possible.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Don’t worry, I’m on my way.”</i>
    He paced to the edge and looked down. The temple sat in contentment,
    waiting with open arms. Lucifer accepted the invitation. To any watcher,
    his fall brought a black speck to break the skies- perhaps a bird. But
    while a bird couldn’t survive this sort of impact, <i>Lucifer</i> could,
    and he already had earlier that day.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Using the same technique he entered the place with, he rolled past the
    shrubbery with unmatched guile. Without question, he’d keep the momentum
    and unlock the doors with equal finesse. They were slammed open with blunt
    force.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    There were too many students for a <i>single</i> temple-full of relics.
    Lucifer couldn’t possibly know there were <i>multiple</i>, although it was
    far more likely contestants launched near the same section would reach the
    same one.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    While the bronze-colored castle resembled a pyramid from the outside,
    inside slept a linear maze. Cobwebs caked the brown bricks. Insects
    squirmed in and out of the cracks. Dust was swept into the air with every
    step. The smell wasn’t much better. And worst of all, the structural
    integrity of the temple was periodically tested, as something favored
    ramming the palace to shake the very foundations.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer <i>couldn’t</i> have been the first to enter. The aisles to the
    main atrium were lined with broken webbing. Somebody clearly stepped
    through, with all of it cleanly cut to the side. This being the case, it
    was puzzling to see none of the relics missing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    They were lined in a circle, each one prone atop a pedestal. The intruder
    walked over to the <b>black knight. </b>This confirmed his suspicions for
    the first time- that <i>chess pieces</i> were being deemed the relics which
    Ozpin sought.
    <b>
        <p>
        </p>
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Finally.</i>
    ” The ground rumbled for the umpteenth time. “Ugh. What is making that
    infernal sound?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I… I think it’s the Creatures of Grimm.” A voice rang out.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What!? Show yourself!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh! Sorry.” A stranger warped into thin air. He had to blink to make sure
    he was seeing right. <i>“It’s going to be alright.</i> I didn’t realize I
    was still hidden.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You can turn invisible?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Y-Yes.” She nodded.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Okay, <i>Hoodie, </i>not bad. You say you know what’s making that noise?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yes. I spotted it outside. It travels underground, where we are now, and
    it likes hitting the temple. It might know we’re in here. Th-That’s not an
issue, is it?” She was indecisive in her mannerisms. “And please, call me    <i>Nadia.”</i> He was already leaving.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The Grimm does not matter to us, for it does not halt us.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Um… You’re right.” Nadia materialized alongside him. “With… With that
    attitude, it’ll <i>never</i> detect us! Good thinking, teammate. Oh, you
    don’t mind having <i>me</i> as your teammate, right?”
    <i>
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You haven’t seen anyone else on the way here, have you?” Lucifer put the
    relic away, granting her question no thought.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Besides the Grimm and yourself, no. I’m sorry.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Then my work is not done.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The pair returned to the surface in silence. By this time, the shaking had
    thinned out, now absent.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well, um, we’ve got plenty of time. We were the first to get those relics.
    Our next move is up to you.” Nadia said.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer turned with a shotgun pointed right at her. She almost immediately
    understood due in part to the insolent growling from behind. Nadia vanished
    from sight, revealing a Beowolf in her wake. The mechanical menace unloaded
    on command, providing significant damage but also downtime, as he now had
    to reload.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A moment of pure confusion took over the beast, not that he cared to
    capitalize on it. Instead <i>Nadia</i> took the reins, reappearing from the
    flanks. It was then that Lucifer noticed her weapon. On each finger she
    wore a <i>needle.</i> Their purpose was shrouded in secrecy. Regardless,
    their effects caused a tantrum fraught with anger, along with a fervent
    bellow of rage. After a short struggle it finally managed to rip Nadia off
    and chuck her into the air.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The sun blinded anyone to her position, and where she’d <i>normally</i>
    fall, there was nothing. <i>Invisible again.</i> The Beowolf must not have
    been very bright, still not quite caught up on the nature of her semblance.
    It paid dearly for its ignorance, enduring several swipes of the needles.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
It seemed the Grimm was undeterred, but just for a moment. It    <i>started</i> charging forward. But its death was hurried. Following its
    disintegration was Lucifer’s curiosity, though it was annexed by his
    discipline.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Poison?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “A-Actually,<i> venom.”</i> She smiled.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So you’re capable. Then we should split up.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “W-Why? All we need to do is return to Headmaster Ozpin.” Nadia didn’t
    quite understand.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Then we’ll go there separately. Cover more ground.” Lucifer lumbered away.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh. Okay. Not that you’d need little ol’ me…”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    With her leave came the foggy remnants of recollection, and Lucifer was
struck with memories of his <i>other</i> teammate. Last he’d seen of her,    <i>she</i> was condemned to a far dive towards the fields of an unforgiving
    wilderness, her fate a true mystery.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    It wouldn’t have been the first time she was cast from the skies today
    alone. <i>“T-That barbarian! He actually let me fall!” </i>Alecto prepared
    her landing strategy, only temporarily distracted by the beautiful
landscape. An onlooker noted she was cutting it about as close as she did    <i>last</i> time, repeatedly twirling her cape in a cyclone fit to slow her
    down. It worked. The delicate nature of her landing fit with the breezy
    plains. More jungle awaited on the brim though, along with a fleeting
    Nevermore.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well done,” the bystander said. “Your landing strategy leaves little to be
    desired.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Huh?” Alecto turned. “H-Headmaster Ozpin?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It would seem.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Um- I don’t mean any disrespect but… What are you doing here? Who’s
    keeping watch on the starting grounds?” For the first time since initiation
    started, she retracted the mask bolted to her arcane-looking helmet to show
    her real face. It was then she noticed somebody standing half behind Ozpin.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hm,” he chuckled. “I appreciate the concern, but Glynda has it under
    control. I’m here to ensure your <i>own</i> safety.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-I can survive a landing just fine.” She didn’t know whether to feel
    flattered or insulted. “I thought you said Beacon staff would refrain from
    assisting us…”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Regarding your <i>enemies,</i> yes. However, I’m perfectly willing to
intervene if it means saving my soon-to-be students from their own    <i>allies.”</i> Ozpin explained. The stranger behind him seemed meek,
    almost afraid to speak.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto looked away. “Yeah, some <i>ally</i> he was. He didn’t have any
    problem letting me go- the <i>nerve</i> of him!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You weren’t in any <i>real</i> danger, Miss Keraseer. You’re quite
    adequate in a pinch.” Ozpin took a sip of cocoa. “I’m aware he struck a
nerve with you, but try and understand <i>his</i> plight. Your new    <i>friend</i> could either let you go, or fall himself, sentencing both of
    you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I guess… Do we even get to keep the relics once we’re done here? I suppose
    it’s not important. What matters is finding them.” She let his words sink
    in. “…Not to mention he was in a greater hurry than I was… Can’t imagine
    why, though.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Perhaps time will tell. And you <i>will</i> be allowed to keep your
    relics.” Ozpin said. “But I must admit, I didn’t come all the way here just
    to tell you that. I also have a favor to ask.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “O-Of course, what do you need?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “This is Miss <i>Selene Virtus</i>.” He stepped aside to fully reveal
    another teenager. “If you would, she could use a hand on her way to the
    temple. She’s a tad young, you see.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nice to meet you, Selene.” She had to lean down to offer her hand.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, um, nice to meet you… My name’s Selene.” She accepted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-I know.” Alecto looked at Ozpin awkwardly. He gave her a reassuring
    smile. “It’s my mission to bring you to the temple and find the relics,
    okay?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t help her <i>too</i> much.” Ozpin was already walking away. “I’d like
    her triumph to feel well-earned.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I understand, Headmaster.” She paused then led her new, <i>new</i>
    teammate in the opposite direction. Hopefully this partner would fare
    better than the last.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “This place is amazing. There’s just so much… <i>Green.</i> Back home,
    there isn’t very much in the way of trees. And your armor is really
    pretty!” Selene lifted her bunched skirt to maintain a clear pace through
    the pastures.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Aw, thanks!” A compliment was a breath of fresh air. “I wish it looked
    half as good as your dress.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Haha! Too bad it isn’t very functional…” She struggled to keep it from
    getting caught on the grass.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well the good news is, even if I fell off that Nevermore, it still flew me
    closer. It won’t be <i>too</i> long before we make it to the temple.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Why <i>were</i> you on that big bird?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Ordinarily I’d never consider going near that <i>filthy abomination</i>
    unless I was trying to <i>kill</i> the thing.” Alecto hesitated then
    brought forth a bare bones recounting of everything that happened since
    initiation started.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He insulted me, and I attacked him. The stranger took the fight to the
    Nevermore, and, well, you saw what happened next.” She finished.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You were <i>fighting someone</i> on the bird!?” Selene looked at her with
    a combination of shock and admiration. “Was it scary?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I was more <i>angry </i>than scared, at least at the time… I mean, he was
    clearly a lone wolf. His insistance to find what I can only assume to be
    his friends didn’t help, but maybe the guy’s just really fanatical about
    them. I can handle a little fall, no problem.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Who could blame someone for caring too much about their friends? If you
    think that’s bad, you should meet-
    <i>
        Gah!“
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    In a flash, something blurred from the trees, tackling Selene to the floor.
    It must’ve had a substantial amount of strength, small as it was.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Selene!” Alecto reacted as expected. The sword was drawn in time with her
    mask dropping. She raised it but paused, fearing the possibility she’d hit
    her own friend. “<i>W-What!? A <b>bunny?”</b> </i>The transition from
    panicked to confused left her speechless. And she wasn’t wrong, either.
    Wrestling with Selene in a friendly manner was a <i>blue-hued bunny. </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Heehee!” She bobbed back on her feet and held up the animal, before
    shortly giving it a deep hug.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Did I get in the wrong ship? Is this initiation or the<i> </i>Circus of
    Freaks?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s initiation!” Selene assured, still snuggling her friend before asking
him a question. “At least, I think it is. Wait, what does    <i>‘initiation’</i> mean?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So what’s this little guy, your <i>pet?”</i> Alecto snorted out in a
    sarcastic manner.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yep!” Selene completely misinterpreted her intent. “His name is Merlin!
    And it’s his job to keep me safe <i>and</i> company! Isn’t that right?” She
    finally let him go, lowering him so he could hop down to ground level.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “W-Wait a minute! I thought that was <i>my</i> job!” Alecto said, meanwhile
Merlin bounced over to inspect her armor. “You’re not telling me    <i>he’s</i> a student too, are you?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No, no, Merlin’s just my friend! And now, he’s yours, too.” They began
    adventuring further into the woods yet again, satiating the hunger for
    conversation. At this point, Selene had broken into a jolly gallop- the
    sort that Alecto could recognize as highly coordinated and skillful, even
    for a skip. It was more like a waltz than a simple walk.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Slow down! There’s only so much to be gained from rushing. Let me guess-
    you like dancing?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Mhm! I <i>love</i> dancing! And singing! It’s one of my favorite things to
    do back home. Can you dance?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto giggled. “No. But I can fight, which takes its own amount of demand
    and prestige.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hmph! I’ll get there, soon!” It was then that the reflection of Alecto’s
    sword, still strapped to her back, shone a light in her eye. “Oh, that’s so
    cool! I love your sword!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, aha, thanks.” Alecto was blushing under her helmet.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Can I see it?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh. Um, okay.” She nervously reached behind her back. “J-Just be careful,
    alright?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Haha! Come, evildoers!” She waved it around in a playful manner. Alecto
    couldn’t help but let out a muffled laugh. “You are no match for
    <i>
        me!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    As if to answer the call, something large stomped out of the trees ahead
    just to let out a hefty roar. The Grimm was not unlike a bear in
    presentation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-I take it back!” She shoved the sword back to Alecto and hid behind her.
    Her protector was ready to take on the cretin without question, that was,
    until her <i>other</i> guardian stepped up to the plate. Merlin leaped in
    front of them both and let out a cute growl. It contrasted well with the
    Ursa’s own mighty howl.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Merlin charged forth and leapt onto the enemy, somehow knocking it flat on
    its back. Through a tree the small animal was thrown in response, the
    wooden monolith snapping in two, but never daring to fall over.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Merlin!” A gasp from Selene came forth. It was seldom needed though as her
    friend reclaimed his footing, grabbed onto the abominable thing with his
    tiny paws, and <i>pulled.</i> To Alecto’s amazement and Selene’s
    encouragement, he forced the Ursa overhead onto its back, shattering a
    nearby boulder into a frenzy of stone shrapnel.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He finished the combo by grabbing the top half of the severed tree and
    whacking the fallen Grimm from above. Alecto had to cover herself from the
    bits of splintery wood twirling in all directions.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Why am I even here!?”</i>
    She shouted, approaching the blast zone to contribute in her own right. The
    Ursa staggered back and prepped yet another assault. A difficult task,
    seeing as Alecto was already on the job, scaling up its back and wrapping
    her sword around the neck for a textbook chokehold.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Grimm was forced away from Merlin, yes, but taking into account who was
    subduing it, the alternate option of nose-diving down to her death wasn’t
exactly optimal either. But downward awaited the temple, so nobody    <i>really</i> cared. Alecto leapt off onto the only ledge in sight,
    opposite the cliff, letting the Grimm savor a dreadful fate.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Now a simple ten-foot rift through the earth separated Alecto from Selene
    and her companion, although <i>they</i> were much higher in elevation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What should we do?” Selene crouched down and pet Merlin. He nodded to her.
    “No, I can’t do <i>that…</i> It’s too difficult, Merlin! That’s why we’re
    here.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Use your landing strategy!” Alecto called from below.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-I don’t have one!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Right, right. Okay, I’ve got it.” Standing ahead were two large towers-
    stone pillars perfect for the job. Now, all she needed to do was break one
    of them such that it fell over the gap, creating a ramp-like walkway
    across. <i>“Alright, simple,”</i> she rationalized. “
    <i>
        A gap between two hills, with one below the other, and two stone
        monoliths.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    She positioned herself at the edge of the decline, then bolted forward.
    Upon passing the first spire, she cleft it with her sword, cracking the
    base. Next, she began a sprint up the second spire, barely reaching the top
    just to vault off. Alecto batted the first one with just enough force to
    topple it over, crossing the gap.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “A-Alecto!” Selene fell back. Her accomplice, despite her worries, fell
    with the bridge and toppled forward just to land alongside her.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m good.” Alecto hopped up, craning her neck to shake off the impact.
    “And even better, the path is clear.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Good work. We’re one step closer to the temple now, right?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto nodded and led downward into the foliage maze. As long as they
continued north like Ozpin said, they’d make it. “There’s going to be more    <i>Grimm</i> here. So stay near me, okay?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Of course.” Selene obeyed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ozpin <i>said</i> you were young. How old are you, if you don’t mind my
    asking?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Just fifteen!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Just</i>
    fifteen.” Alecto chuckled. Merlin hopped forward to join her in the front.
    “That’s pretty young for Beacon Academy… I mean, not in a <i>bad</i> way.
It’s just, you must be <i>some</i> fighter to have gotten in early. When    <i>I</i> was your age…” She couldn’t finish.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, aha.” Selene let out a nervous giggle. “Well, there’s always room for
    improvement, right?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Huh.” The sun echoed off of Selene’s chaplet. “I’ve never seen <i>that</i>
    type of dust.” Alecto was referring to a crystal enthroned on the
    princess’s tiara.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Oh! It’s- um,</i>
    it’s nothing special.” Selene stuttered. “I-It’s just for looks.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It does a good job. <i>Wait.”</i> Something halted her. “What’s that?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The <i>top</i> of an amber bastille sat just ahead.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It must be the temple!” Selene hopped up and down.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “C’mon!” Alecto ran across a bridge constructed from little more than
    planks. That, considering her heavy armor’s constant attempts to weight her
    down, was a poor choice. She broke through, only barely able to hold onto a
    sheer of spare, weathered wood.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hold on!” Selene stepped over and grabbed her hand. But she alone could
    not pull Alecto up. Merlin had to pitch in too, but in doing so, he broke
    the entire bridge into a spectacle of<i> </i>dull shards.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto could handle the situation. But she had great doubts Selene could do
    the same. That didn’t change her mission. So she grabbed hold of her midair
    and shielded her.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Argh!” Her decision took a chunk of her Aura away, and it threw her sword
    to the outskirts of the hole. Granted, it could have been much worse. The
    pet bunny landed in a similar fashion, but due to his light stature it
    wasn’t <i>that</i> big of a deal. “I-I’m okay!” Once she’d received
    confirmation of Alecto’s good health, Selene went to check on Merlin.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A <i>Creeper</i> of all things decided now would be the best time to
    intervene. With no weapon to defend herself with, and a lack of recovery
    from her recent ordeal, Alecto couldn’t do anything but <i>attempt</i> to
    wrestle it away. Selene’s eyes locked on her troubled teammate, before
    gravitating to her dagger.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    ”Get <i>off</i> of me!” She barked. It didn’t listen, and the scuffle
    continued. It came to <i>quick</i> end, however, once the Creeper was
    stabbed through the chest from behind. Everything froze until Alecto
    realized what happened, and she waited for the Grimm to wither away before
    assessing the situation further.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“…Selene?” The young empress in question was on her knees, looking down.    <i>“Selene. </i>What’s the matter?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I… I’ve never killed anything before.” She broke out of her trance. Dead
    silence formed a rift between the two.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It was a <i>Grimm.</i> It would have shown you the same mercy.” She held
    her hand out. “And you <i>saved</i> me. It had to be done.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Y-You’re right.” Selene accepted the offer. “It was just a Grimm.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yes. Grimm are <i>horrible</i> creatures, a blight on mankind- born of
    darkness.” Alecto guided the band deep into the temple, shimmying through
    the dank caverns. “They have no empathy, no <i>soul. </i>Truly disgusting.
    You’re never wrong to kill them.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I know. It’s just, I’ve fought Grimm before, but I always leave the last
    part to Merlin.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Never mind that. Look at this.” They reached the center. “These must be
    the relics. Which one should we take?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, we need to take <i>this</i> one!” She was quick to choose. A fair few
    relics were already missing, but the one she was searching for was spared.
    “The black horsey!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Alright, if you say so. That’s one of my favorites in chess, anyway.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The outside world welcomed them back. A straight shot forward brought the
    trio to the brink of a mountain.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Our quest is done- now we just rebound back to the beginning.” Alecto
    hiked to the path’s end.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yay! I actually made it past my first day! And it’s because of you. You
    did it!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t be silly. <i>We</i> did it.” The trio stood, locked in time,
    entranced by the sunset. For a moment the only sound to be heard was the
    airy breeze and ambiance of the forest. It was not to last, as frantic but
    calculated footsteps were added to the mix.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto was given just enough time to look back and push Selene away in a
    panic, as a familiar friend was already at her throat.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Lucifer!?” Selene herself stumbled to the floor, dirtying her dress. As
    she observed, Lucifer rushed into Alecto. What she <i>couldn’t</i>
    comprehend were his reasons why.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He let out a snarl, tackling Alecto to the ground. “Get <i>away</i> from-!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He had no time. Something big and bulky smashed out of the floor,
interrupted Lucifer, and blasted chunks of ground everywhere. The new    <i>Grimm</i> snatched him off of Alecto and threw him back down, once again
    tossing shrapnel around.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Argh!” Lucifer redirected his attention to this <i>thing.</i> What stood
    forth was an amalgamation unlike anything he’d ever seen, a Grimm holding a
    round physique and a <i>terrifying</i> grin.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Selene! </i>
    Behind me, now!” Lucifer ran in front of her.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What <i>is</i> that!?” She followed his command.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“That</i>
    ’s the <b><i>Grover!”</i></b> Alecto raised herself <i>and</i> her sword.
    “Think of it like a giant gopher! Keep your distance, and don’t stop
    moving!”
    <i>
        First things first, study the battlefield. An open area and a square
        barrier <b>right</b> on the edge of a cliff.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This Grimm seemed foreign to its combatants. Fat and circular, with razor
    teeth to match, the <i>Grover</i> couldn’t be overestimated despite
    matching only an alpha Beowolf in height. Lucifer dismissed Alecto’s advice
    and stood his ground, firing upon the behemoth.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Grover laughed it off.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You <i>fool!</i> That’ll just agitate it!” Alecto berated her rival, not
    that he could even hear her. He was too busy <i>missing</i> this freak, who
    tunneled underground, and getting caught out- although Grover merely lunged
    past with a <i>different</i> target in mind. Its approach failed. Instead
    of taking out Selene as planned, its jaws closed around Lucifer’s
    <i>
        arm.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“No!”</i>
He wrestled around, slamming his fists on it over and over, making    <i>sure</i> it went nowhere near Selene. Grover <i>had</i> to put an end to
    the barrage. Thus it slid underground, taking Lucifer with it.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Merlin!” Selene failed to stop <i>him</i> from following the train of
    destruction. Alecto halted <i>her</i> from doing the same, pulling her to
    the backline.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Stay there!” It was time to raise the stakes. “Grover is a deadly potent
    entity. Despite my own hate for those <i>demons,</i> you <i>must</i>
    respect their power. Be aware.” Her cape was pulled back to reveal a second
    weapon, one she <i>resisted</i> using this entire time. Her <i>old</i>
    brand was already impressive: a traditional silver short sword with symbols
    up and down the blade. This new one resembled a golden broadsword with a
    jagged pattern cut out. “I must use the
    <i>
        Keraseer Heirloom.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The ground was torn up, surely a result of Grover’s expedition through the
    surface. Whatever was going on below, it was causing an eerie ruckus.
Selene hoped Alecto’s extreme caution was unfounded, otherwise they might    <i>actually</i> be in trouble.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Fortunately the ground puffed up beneath and <i>past</i> them. Lucifer was
    the first to pop out, Grover pushing him upward with untamed ferocity.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Grah!” He was slammed into a massive concrete idol, one of the few manmade
    structures that <i>wasn’t</i> eaten up by the forest. Grover was like a
    gorilla in nature, simply swinging on its foe rather than using its claws.
    After soaking up so much damage, Lucifer had the sense to retaliate in
    full.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Grover rolled back at a punch, giggling every chance it had. Backup plan or
    not, it didn’t matter. Merlin was <i>going </i>to hop out of the hole after
    them and stop this either way. A pair of paws tugged the gargantuan Grimm
    away just to throw it back. Lucifer was ready and ducked, giving Grover the
    same treatment he himself had received moments ago.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Enough! That won’t do anything!” Alecto shouted, before impaling Grover,
    who only whooped louder, in the shoulder. As it laughed, it seemed to
    become more dangerous. In a cyclone it twirled. Alecto wouldn’t give up the
sword though. Seeing as it was still lodged in Grover’s back, she    <i>too</i> spun off the ground.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Everyone else dodged, meanwhile she did little other than hold on,
    disregarding the disorientation. Fortunately the longsword gave up before
    she did, finally detaching. <i>Unfortunately,</i> she was now streaming
    through the air with enough velocity to crack the familiar rock wall.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Are you okay!?” Selene crawled over to her and helped her up, although
    Alecto barely needed it.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t worry about me.” She was pelted with something furry, falling back
    onto the slab. “Merlin!? You’re supposed to be on our side!” Next up was
    Lucifer. <i>He</i> fell even harder, squashing both of them.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Alright, <i>‘Grimm Expert.’</i> How do we beat it!?” He grappled Alecto to
    her feet.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The Grover’s too durable. Only this blade can-“
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer didn’t care. He wasn’t about to sit idle, listening when Grover was
    busy closing in on <i>Selene.</i> They traded blows, flying back to their
    corners. But as far as casualties, Selene’s <b>headdress</b> was the only
    thing to be lost. When Lucifer skid into her in as gentle a manner as
    possible, it fell loose.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “My tiara!” She reached forward in pure desperation. The token rolled away
    into the clutches of the enemy. Grover was in hysterics, glaring down at
    the shiny object. It impulsively raised its spiked foot before bringing the
    hammer down.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“No!”</i>
    Lucifer swung into a full sprint as Grover put all its weight onto the
    headpiece. He was too late.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    But the circlet <i>didn’t</i> break, rather, it did the <i>opposite</i>. A
    surge of blinding light came forth, and the explosion did escalating damage
    based on proximity.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Grover was nowhere to be seen, granted nobody <i>could</i> see. Nobody but
    Lucifer, whose visor shielded his eyes. That didn’t change the fact that
    the shockwave blew him back into the concrete structure. After so much
    abuse, it finally gave out, shattering itself as well as Lucifer’s own
    Aura.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Lucifer!” Selene cried out. She ran over to the edge as fast as she could,
    relieved but still alert at seeing him hang on. “C’mon, you
    can’t fall now!” She grabbed his hand but could do little to help him up
    without further assistance.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Here!” Alecto came to her aid. With the two of them, it wasn’t long until
    Lucifer was back on solid land. Everyone struggled to catch their breath.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Selene!” Lucifer embraced her. His mechanical mask retracted to show his
    true eyes, his appearance no longer complimented by the red ghastly ones he
    donned before. Alecto was surprised such a thing could even be done.
    “You’re alright! Praise be to Atlas! You’ve not laid eyes on any other
    students besides her, right? Tell me you picked the black knight!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s right, just like you said! We’re <i>teammates</i> now, Lucifer!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “And I couldn’t forget about <i>you.”</i> His voice turned coy, capturing
    the attention of Merlin. “You kept her safe, didn’t you?” The bunny nodded
    before cuddling up against him.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He wasn’t the only one.” Alecto crossed her arms. “I finally caught your
    name. <i>Lucifer,</i> huh? Not bad, although a <i>thanks</i> wouldn’t go
    amiss.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You protected her?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “At Ozpin’s request.” She tried to act aloof, but her good deed couldn’t be
    denied.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Thank you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Aw, how sweet!” Selene cheered.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Ugh.</i>
    You don’t still have my cape, do you?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s in a tree somewhere.” Alecto admitted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Wait a second! Where’s the <i>tiara!?”</i> Lucifer’s work was never done.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where it once sat, nothing <i>visible</i> remained. The mystery became
    clear as soon as Lucifer bolted over and <i>hit</i> something.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What!?” He kept from falling over, arming himself at the slightest sign of
    treachery. Ahead of him <i>Nadia</i> materialized, and the tiara did the
    same.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “S-Sorry!” The rogue scrambled to her feet and offered the prized
    possession forward. “I-I thought… This belongs to you, doesn’t it?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nadia!? What are you doing here?” He quickly took it back.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, well, um. You guys are my teammates now. I <i>had</i> to keep an eye
    on you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Wait, you two met? When?” Selene centered her tiara.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “At the temple.” He clarified, reaching back and presenting his relic.
    Alecto did the same, holding up the chess pieces in the air. Positioned on
    a high valley overlooking the entirety of the Emerald Forest, they caught
    the sunlight well enough to provide a notable glint. The sight was
    magnificent.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How appropriate. <i>Black knights.”</i> Alecto remarked, still raising the
    relic and watching the horizon.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I wonder what these pieces do. They can’t mean anything, can they? Do you
    think Headmaster Ozpin will let us keep them?” Selene asked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Maybe. I have an idea. A-As long as it’s okay with you guys… Just in case
    we can hold onto them, we should give them some sort of meaning. Like, as
    our first achievement in Beacon together. I understand if it was a bad
    idea...” The suggestion from Nadia garnered a wave of excitement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No, it’s good! You’re right. Ozpin told me we’d be able to stash them.
    These should stand for something. As long as each of us has one of these
    relics, we’ll always have each other’s backs. Right?” Alecto nudged Lucifer
    in the shoulder.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Affirmative. To the Black Knights.” They cheered. All that was left to be
    done was return from whence they’d come. An effortless trek back. Both the
    trip and the subsequent assigning of teams blew by in a instant, and before
    long, every student was settled in the haven of Beacon Academy.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Anyone else dead tired?” Alecto questioned her new friends, Lucifer
    specifically, while musing at the elegant simplicity of Beacon Academy’s
    hallways. “It probably doesn’t help that you <i>asked</i> for the top
    floor.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Um, there’s an elevator, you know.” Nadia pointed at the lift, her fingers
    exaggerated by the iron nails.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh. I <i>didn’t</i> know. Well that sucks. Why did we walk up all those
    stairs?” She huffed out.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I figured you could use the exercise.” Lucifer chuckled for the first time
    since arriving.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re unbelievable.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I think this is the correct room.” Lucifer read the directions on his
    scroll. On one of the doors remained a card with metallic letters printed
    on it. “<i>L-A-N-S,”</i> it read. “Affirmative. <i>Team Lance.”</i> He
    unlocked the entrance.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Alright! Team Lance is ready to roll!” Selene threw the door open and ran
    inside, then immediately collapsed on one of the beds. Nadia held back
    laughter.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Not bad. Not as good as my old one… But not bad. It could be a little
    roomier, though.” Alecto noted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The closets are pretty big. And there are <i>two.”</i> Lucifer was already
    on the case, interviewing Nadia and Alecto. “How many clothes do you two
    have?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Me? Uh- My robes are all I basically wear, so I brought a lot with me…
    Sorry.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I have a suit of armor.” Alecto’s entire wardrobe could be summed up in
    one sentence.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “As do I. So you and I don’t <i>need</i> a closet.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I guess not-“
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Great.” Lucifer didn’t leave her the chance to refuse. “So, we’ll put one
bed in the <i>closet,</i> two beds on either side of the room, and    <b>throw one away. </b>Does that sound like a worthy operation?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That makes no sense. <i>First,</i> what do you mean we’re throwing one
    away?” Alecto poked several holes in his plan. “So you’re telling me
    somebody’s going to be sleeping on the ground? It won’t be me. I promise
    you that.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t need a bed.” Lucifer laid it down.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…You don’t need a <i>bed?</i> Are you sure?” Nadia detached her glove and
    set it on the sheets.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Affirmative.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I mean, I guess I’m fine with sleeping in here. Does it have a lock?”
    Alecto proceeded with the inspection. “Ugh, it doesn’t. I’ll have to throw
    one in here as soon as possible, but I guess it’ll do for tonight. I swear,
    if <i>any</i> of you walk in on me while I’m sleeping, I’ll <i>hurt</i>
    you.” She was already effortlessly heaving the mattress, bed-frame
    included, into the closet.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “There, perfect floor plan. I’ll take care of <i>my</i> bed by morning.” He
    fake clapped for himself then walked over to open the window. Selene pulled
    herself off her bed to join him.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Woah!” She gasped. A majority of the combat school could be seen all the
    way down to the courtyard near the entrance. The Emerald Forest and its
neighboring bay couldn’t be missed, and behind it a bombardment of    <i>silver mountains</i> lurked, illuminated by the shattered moon. Had they
    been on one of the lower floors, such a view would be impossible. She was
    thankful.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer put his hand on her shoulder. “Pretty good, huh? I know the view’s
    not as nice as the one at home, but it should suffice.” She gave him a
    hefty hug. It was hard to believe she’d already crossed the first hurdle of
    Beacon Academy. But there were far more to come. As new students under the
    watch of an <i>Oathkeeper clad in bloody rags,</i> the four had already
    sparked a new journey. They were eager, although not quite ready, to tackle
    whatever threats Remnant was willing to throw at them.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps our heroes should bear in mind the dangers of such a task. This
place is unfriendly, wary, hardly the place for a bunch of teenagers.    <i>Huntsmen and Huntresses?</i> That was another story.
