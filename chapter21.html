    “Are we dealing with a simple invasion, or is there something bigger at
    stake?” Diana asked.
</p>
<p>
    <em>“You’re</em>
    not dealing with anything. You’ll be safe, behind me.” Eos answered through
    the holes in her mask, chuckling. A <em>black vulture</em> flapped its way
    into the speeding carriage, before mutely cawing something to her. “Did
    Sister Artemis send you? …Yes, I see. Sister Artemis is already there. The
    walls of the incoming city haven’t been bypassed, <em>yet.</em> And so far,
    there’s been zero sign of aerial Grimm.”
</p>
<p>
    “Unfortunate. I was hoping we’d take the fight to the skies, away from the
    people.” Eleanor said.
</p>
<p>
    “Besides the three of us and Sister Artemis, everyone is either late or
    occupied across Remnant with their own Grimm raid.”
</p>
<p>
    “W-Will they arrive soon?” Diana shivered at the lack of reinforcements.
</p>
<p>
    <em>“You’ll be fine!”</em>
    Somebody from the front of the freight whooped while whipping the horses to
    speed up. <strong>“Clotho’s Coven</strong> has never once lost a fight!
    Least, that’s what I’ve been told. I just can’t believe I got a chance to
    meet some of them! It’s not every day a humble merchant gets the chance to
    ferry the warriors whose glory is rumored high and low!”
</p>
<p>
    “Lady Clotho thanks you. What’s your name, anyway?” Eleanor turned.
</p>
<p>
    “That would be <em>Troy! </em>Did I mention what an honor it is to meet you
    three?” The chariot surged forward, the dirt path uncharitably forming into
    a rocky road. Behind them, the sun followed from the horizon. But ahead,
    past the smoke of a village beset by darkness, the sky was still downcast.
    “Whup! Sorry for that bump!”
</p>
<p>
    “Do you have the weapon?” Eos questioned Diana. In response, she struggled
    to lift a golden great sword strapped to her back. “I know, it’s
    cumbersome. But she really is something special. You’ll grow into it within
    a year. I’m sure of it.”
</p>
<p>
    “Th-That’s the same thing you said <em>last</em> year. Whether or not I get
    the hang of it soon, you don’t expect me to actually use it now, right? I-I
    don’t think I’m ready.”
</p>
<p>
    “Not at all. But as <em>Bearer of <strong>Tormentyst,</strong></em> it is
    forever yours to command. You’ll have to grow accustomed to its presence.
    In time, you’ll be attuned with its nature.”
</p>
<p>
    “We’re here.” Eleanor declared, gesturing to Diana. “Stay behind Sister
    Eos. She’ll tell you <em>what</em> to do, and <em>when!” </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Hey! Save some for me, ladies!” Troy hopped down to see them charge past
    the gates of this besieged capital with brutish abandon. The horrible
    creatures responsible for their arrival weren’t satisfied with just
    crumbling the ageless architecture, wildly obsessed with finishing off what
    remained of the scorned population. Too many had died already.
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Do not spare a single Grimm.”</em>
    Eos commanded. Not needed. Eleanor sliced through the hordes without mercy,
    using a more traditional blade that was easily stained. From westward, an
    arrow sailed past her to stop the incursion of a Beowolf and the pack it
    led, each of them fizzling into dust by the time the attack had concluded.
    That one arrow stopped ten Grimm.
</p>
<p>
    “Sister Artemis!” Eleanor called to the distant bell tower.
</p>
<p>
    “Aye!” A figure waved, cupping her hands.
</p>
<p>
    “What do you see?”
</p>
<p>
    After a swarm of vultures perched on the bow of Artemis, prepped to report
    the spoils of a birds’ eye view, they found their answer. “There are more
    approaching over the mountain! Open the gates, and prepare a pyre!”
</p>
<p>
    Eleanor understood. She’d permit entry, then fortify that lapse with
    smoldering flames. The Grimm could never neglect a break in the town’s
    defenses, even if it meant stampeding each other through a moat of raking
    hot coals nurtured to kill. And kill, they did. But while that worked
    splendidly, opposite the farce, Eos was forced to take more drastic
    measures outside the village walls.
</p>
<p>
    “I know you have a <em>tad</em> more experience than me, but I think it’s
    safe to say we may need those other Coven members you mentioned earlier.”
    Troy was forced to join Diana behind Eos, whose incredible height and
    constitution saved all for the time being.
</p>
<p>
    “We can take the Grimm no problem. It’s not us I’m worried about. This
    place can’t be saved, there’s just too much strife. Follow me.” Eos ran to
    the idol that acted as a crow’s nest for Artemis. In the main hall, the
    townspeople cowered even if relieved to see another fabled devotee. She
    held Diana by the shoulder. “Go upstairs to Sister Artemis. Tell her I’m
    taking the citizens far away. <em>She</em> will protect you.”
</p>
<p>
    “And what of me? I’ll accompany you.” Eleanor insisted. “Sister Artemis
    won’t fail if she only needs to protect one of us, and not an army of
    humans.”
</p>
<p>
    “W-What about me?” Diana opened her arms for her own hug. She was not
    disappointed even as, several stories above, Artemis sent scores of
    Beowolves to the depths, forming a deadly aura whereupon any who entered
    received a speeding, pointy welcome. She wasn’t alone <em>anymore.</em>
    “Hey! I was told to stay with you. The others are evacuating the city.”
</p>
<p>
    “Smart.” Artemis said. “It’s been awhile, but let us continue your
    training. A real attack is the best time to practice. You’ll remember your
    lesson better.”
</p>
<p>
    The population was smothered into a caravan, everyone hoping to take
    advantage of the lapse in Grimm. <em>“Thank you, oh brave saints!”</em> One
    of the rescued chanted, drawing a positive murmur from the rest. Troy paid
    them no notice, and cut between the celebrated warriors of Eos and Eleanor.
</p>
<p>
    “So, err, I guess this is where we part ways?”
</p>
<p>
    “Actually, we could still use your help.” Eleanor stopped him. “If you
    would lead the march, then we could keep watch from behind. We’re going to
    one of the <strong>Nomadic Outposts</strong> nearby, right here.”
</p>
<p>
Troy studied the map, readying the horses. “Sure thing. But what’s a    <em>Nomadic Outpost?” </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Settlements the Coven constructed long ago. They serve as resting grounds
    for anyone that’s been exiled from their home. Nobody who goes in there
    stays long, so they’re pretty small- and that allows for extra
    fortifications fit to keep Grimm out.”
</p>
<p>
    “Gotcha. We’ll be there by midday.” He rolled his foreign dice, and raised
    a brow at the result. “I expect good things from this journey!”
</p>
<p>
    From the splintered city, they paced themselves well, the rumbling of
    another horrific swarm providing fine motivation. The concept that Artemis
    and Diana may fall was unfathomable, neither knight daring to even consider
such an atrocity. Instead, they spoke of the <em>good.</em> The    <em>righteous.</em>
</p>
<p>
    “So. How many did you kill back there?” Eleanor giggled.
</p>
<p>
    “I lost count, honestly. You should’ve <em>seen</em> that outer wall. Half
    the time I was just ripping them down by the feet.”
</p>
<p>
    “What, they were <em>scaling</em> the walls?”
</p>
<p>
    “I’m serious.” Eos wiped her polearm of blood and dirt. “Now, where were we
    before duty called? Oh, that’s right. <em>Armor.” </em>
</p>
<p>
    “I already told you, your armor’s <em>fine.</em> You’re nigh untouchable
    anyway, there’s no need for any more. It’ll just make you slower. If you
    want to know the truth, I probably like your armor best of them all. I’d
    take it for a spin myself, if I wasn’t so small<em>.”</em>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re not small.” Eos said. “I’m just <em>huge.</em> I guess I just can’t
    help myself. Ha.” Eos said.
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t beat yourself up. Good armor is hard to come by! If only our enemies
    were as rare.” Eleanor stopped and whistled, garnering everyone’s
    attention. “Wait here, please! The two of us will scout ahead for a moment,
    to check for Grimm. We’ll be right back in mere minutes, if that.”
</p>
<p>
    What they found was a canyon home to a bridge. Perilous for sure, but if
    that was all, then the mission might yet be trivial. Upon returning to the
    convoy, Eos was first to turn the corner. She stopped dead in her tracks,
    covered Eleanor’s mouth, and pulled them both behind cover. In that small
    window, she spotted two wretched hellions, each saddled upon a shriveled
    steed- their literal bony appearance contained within flowing, tattered
    robes. This sight was sufficient to bring panic. “Don’t make a sound. There
    are two <em>Eidolons</em> out there.”
</p>
<p>
Eleanor’s body language stiffened. Her voice implied alarm.    <em>“The Black Horsemen!?</em> What were they doing?”
</p>
<p>
    “Holding a picture of someone to Troy.” She was right. The scrawled
    portrait was accurate too, showcasing Artemis. The Eidolons must’ve sought
    the members of the Coven, and though they couldn’t speak, Troy understood
    their desires. Their black physique almost forced an answer, everyone
    terrified at the presence of towering <strong>skeletons,</strong> their
    skin stripped bare for all to see.
</p>
<p>
    “We need to help them.” Eleanor already knew she was wrong, and Eos was
    ready to reel her in.
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t be so eager. Remember, their lust for humans are absent. So long as
    we remain hidden, nobody needs to die.”
</p>
<p>
    “Aha, err…” Troy nervously chuckled, his aggressors leaning in. <em>If</em>
    they were Grimm, it was the first time he’d ever seen one negotiate. “I’ve
    never seen anyone who looks like <em>that.”</em> In a haze, one of the
    specters pointed to the humans, causing them to cower. “Them? N-No, you’ve
    got it all wrong! They weren’t saved by that woman! I found them scrambling
    from a tribe of faunus!”
</p>
<p>
    One of the two Eidolons nodded to the other, and plucked a toddler from the
    crowd, to everyone’s horror. If there <em>were</em> any Silver-Eyed heroes
    nearby, this bait would prove fruitful, as Eleanor feared this wasn’t even
a bluff- after all, what was the harm in <em>one</em> innocents’ blood to a    <em>Grimm?</em> They had to be stopped.
</p>
<p>
    Eos rushed one of them down, using what vacant sunlight available to her as
    cover, hoping to pike them both through the chest at the same time. The
    closest rider caught the shaft of her weapon in an instant, and launched
    her into the ground. The stone cracked, but Eos appeared unaffected.
</p>
<p>
    “Troy! Take them to the Nomadic Outpost!” Eleanor shouted.
</p>
<p>
    “Are you sure? Y-You won’t die here, right?”
</p>
<p>
    “Just do as I say.” He understood in full, and led a charge away from the
    ensuing battle. “Sister Eos? Should we use our <strong>power?”</strong>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t you recall last time? Or the time before <em>that?</em> These unholy
    creatures hold dominion over an equally potent set of mystic arts.
    Unfortunately, we’ll have to get through this with our <em>acquired</em>
    skills, not our <em>natural </em>ones.”
</p>
<p>
    “Just making sure.” She narrowed both her eyes on the exposed bone holding
their bodies together, then whispered in absolute.    <em>“Well… To use that magic, they <strong>will</strong> need arms…”</em>
</p>
<p>
    Within these infinite lowlands, the battled raged, fought in full by
    representatives hailing from a council of vassals commanded in silence by
    the gods. But none of that meant anything in the face of Grimm old enough
    to <em>learn,</em> to <em>strategize,</em> to <em>plan.</em> The Horsemen
    had scoured the lands, they could’ve rode <em>anywhere anytime,</em> yet
    they chose to fight <em>here.</em>
</p>
<p>
    Eos and Eleanor were faring terribly. The height advantage, and mobility
    from tamed beasts couldn’t be overemphasized, as one of them used a razor
    sickle bolted atop a pole, and the other a chain whip. It served its
    purpose beautifully. The clash of these repurposed tools sent violent
    echoes past the waves of seas.
</p>
<p>
    It wasn’t until one of the Eidolon’s disarmed Eos with the metal chain
    links that the other speared her in the shoulder. Eleanor didn’t notice,
    for this was the opening she longed for. Finally, she managed to lodge her
    sword through the armpit of the closest equerry and pull, dislocating the
    arm and sending a spray of black liquid over her suit- a gift from the
    horse. At last, she beamed forward with her silver eyes, two streams of
    white energy plummeting into the Grimm, who couldn’t absorb the attack with
    only <em>one</em> hand. Even the extra Eidolon <em>behind</em> it was
    enveloped in an unbreakable mold of rock. It was a bittersweet victory.
</p>
<p>
    “Sister Eos? <em>Sister!”</em> Eleanor scrambled to her side and held a
    hand to the wound, halting the flow of blood. “No! Please gods, no!”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“I-I’ll live. Don’t fret, please.” </em>
    She coughed. “It’s been years since I took a hit like that. I-I guess I was
    right about needing that armor upgrade, huh?”
</p>
<p>
    “Thank his Majesty you’re alright. We can go find something sturdier
    together. But we cannot stay <em>here.</em> They’ll smash their way out,
    soon. This is our chance. We can make it to the Heart of the Coven before
    they even know we’re gone.” She was right, for when frozen by the primeval
    silver eyes, one was incapable of perceiving whatever time was spent
    captive until freed.
</p>
<p>
    Eos stood up on her own, only allowing Eleanor to drape a hand around her
    for show. “You know, for all the times we’ve ran away from one of these
things, one day I’d like to finally <strong>kill</strong> one. Now, it’s<em>personal. </em>Ugh, what would I do without you? Your eyes always    <em>were</em> more powerful than mine. Ha.”
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t mention it. If that’s all that mattered, Diana would outclass us
    all.” Eleanor said.
</p>
<p>
    “Well, in a matter of speaking, she already has.”
</p>
<p>
    Back in the city, the invading numbers dwindled but never stopped
    completely, giving Artemis the perfect controlled environment to train
    Diana, even if the youngest of them dreaded the thought of working on the
    field. Artemis just wouldn’t take no for an answer.
</p>
<p>
    Struggling to hold Tormentyst steady, she managed to defeat a fair few
    considering the sword did most of the work. Though, she was nowhere near
    adept yet. From the distance, her temporary mentor would step in with
    arrows if the situation ever turned messy, or more than one Grimm advanced
    at a time.
</p>
<p>
    “That’s far enough.” She declared, shooting the last assailant before
    landing in front of Diana. “You did well. Your form has improved over the
    last many moons, but you’re still relying too much on Tormentyst. I know it
    severs anything it touches without effort, but it’s a long road to a
    skilled swordswoman if you <em>abuse</em> that.”
</p>
<p>
    “…” Diana dropped her possession, her arms aching. “It’s too much. Why do I
    have to use this stupid sword? A-Aren’t I the youngest? It’s far better
    utilized by <em>anyone</em> else.”
</p>
<p>
    Artemis <em>considered</em> discipline of such hubris, but instead crossed
    her arms. “…You’re lucky! Not many can get away with such rejection of Lady
    Clotho’s gifts. The sword is special, and is only reserved for the most
    gifted. That means <em>you.</em> It took us all many years to gain a
    mastery over it. I know you feel you’ve been at this for too long, but with
    time, you’ll gain control. That’s a Sister’s promise. <em>I’ll</em> guide
    you. We all will.”
</p>
<p>
    Another messenger landed on Artemis’ shoulder, informing her of the recent
    events plaguing the northern trail. “…I see. We’re finished here.”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“What?” </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Eleanor and Eos went to head-to-head with two Eidolons. There could be
    more nearby. Or their <em>captain. </em>You’ve never fought one, and I’m
    quite content to keep it that way.”
</p>
<p>
    “W-Who is the Captain, anyway?” Diana asked, impulsively checking her
    surroundings in a fit of fear and paranoia.
</p>
<p>
    “Have you been keeping up with your studies? Follow my example. I’ve only
    just started the tablets left by Lady Clotho. Those come after the ancient
    tomes from the Arbiter. What about you?”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Seventh</em>
    Generation.”
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, that explains it!” Artemis laughed, pointing upward. “A pop quiz,
    then! How do we navigate our way back to the keep?”
</p>
<p>
    “It’s… the constellations, right? Don’t some of them point the way at
    certain times of the month?” Diana dragged Tormentyst over and used it to
lean on, looking to the skies. “Maybe we follow the pattern of    <em>Sir Kyradin Bael?”</em>
</p>
<p>
    “I only wish so charitable an ally was the answer. Look further east, where
the sun rises.    <em>The Caliph of Dusk and Dawn, <strong>Odynavus,</strong> </em>is the
    key.”
</p>
<p>
    “My apologies, Sister Artemis.”
</p>
<p>
    “Not an issue. Just keep hitting those books.” As they followed the
    directions of the cadaverous Odynavus mural far above, Artemis thought it
    best to back up and answer the original question. “Now, the Captain of the
    Eidolons is called that for a reason. They are the nightmarish crew of the
    ship <em>‘Falsus Heredis’, </em>commanded by an unseen warrior in secret.
    Not yet has anyone identified whatever <em>abomination</em> would take such
    pleasure in ordering the Black Horsemen. Back in the day, rumor was, they
    were called <em>‘Aku.’ </em>Anyone who’s encountered the ship has never
    survived to confirm, though.”
</p>
<p>
    “S-So you’ve never <em>fought</em> the Captain?”
</p>
<p>
    “No one in the Coven has. Long ago, when it plagued the waters for years,
    we must’ve been lucky in missing it. And after that, the <em>vessel</em>
    disappeared. It’s been generations years since the <em>Falsus Heredis</em>
    has been spotted on the high seas. Most think it’s been retired, Aku still
    waiting somewhere, sending their <em>dogs</em> to hunt as a twisted
    pastime.”
</p>
<p>
    Diana again shivered at the thought. “Y-You’re just messing with me, right?
    Why is Kingdom Lore so scary?”
</p>
<p>
    “Haha. You’ll be fine. Nothing’s going to happen to you. Enough talk of the
    past. Are there any signal fires to indicate another invasion in the
    present?”
</p>
<p>
    They saw nothing but the pattern of stars that substituted a guide. That
    trend continued for nearly an hour, until they’d stopped at an inexplicable
    shrine cut into the side of a mountain, held to a jungle by one lone
    rickety bridge. “I’m thankful we didn’t have to stray too far from here.”
    Diana sighed.
</p>
<p>
    “One last test. Reveal the gates.”
</p>
<p>
    “But can’t you? I’ve already-“ Diana stopped herself, already sensing a
    strict refusal. “Okay, fine. Here, take this.” She handed away her antique
    sword, took a deep breath, and lifted the metal veil bolted over her face
    with several clasps and locks.
</p>
<p>
    “Wait. Let me help you.” Artemis laid a hand on each shoulder. “Close your
    eyes. Focus on dulling your senses. Remember your training. Relax your
    body, and hold <em>onto</em> this feeling.” Her voice became soft. “Isolate
    yourself from the <em>world.</em> Yes, <em>perfect.</em> Now, slowly, open
    your eyes.”
</p>
<p>
    None of this was done to produce a surge from Diana. That could’ve been
    done easily enough. Anytime her silver eyes were exposed, no longer
    confined by the specially made helmet, she could hardly <em>stop</em>
    herself from bringing forth a dire stream of omnipotent vigor. Grimm and
man alike were obliterated in an instant. She had to control it.    <em>Restrain it.</em>
</p>
<p>
    With some help, she managed to produce <em>only</em> a laser-like beam.
    Immediately, Artemis strapped the mask back in place and Dianna allowed the
    incredible stream of annihilation to pour into her enchanted visor again.
    “Thank you, Sister Artemis.” Using this power, the solid wall ahead
    shimmered and riveted, the very platform upon which they stood spinning to
    take them into the sheer hillside.
</p>
<p>
    Within the Heart of the Coven, past another bridge, they came upon a
    mirage. This shimmering wall made the other side appear as though it were
    underwater, subject to rippling. But once they’d slipped through, the view
    was clear. Inside Remnant rested a golden temple, the architect of which
    lavished the halls with sizable diners, forums, and chapels- each corner
    illuminated by a stained glass window, light streaming in despite the
    castle’s position within a mountain. No expense was spared. It would’ve
    been easy for the carefully vetted inhabitants to find themselves lost if
    they weren’t so experienced.
</p>
<p>
    “Sisters! I received your message. You’re not hurt, are you?” Artemis
    rushed over at the sight of the two who’d split up to begin with.
</p>
<p>
    “Thankfully not.” Eos stood up, apparently accustomed to walking off
    injuries any ordinary human would find fatal. But that seemed to be a trend
    among them all.
</p>
<p>
    “Which Eidolons were they? Did you kill one?”
</p>
<p>
    Eleanor answered. “There were two. The first mate with the Scythe, and its
    Quartermaster. We couldn’t stop them. It was standard procedure.”
</p>
<p>
    “Where are they, now?”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Far</em>
    from here. They could’ve escaped by this point, but I’m doubtful we were
    followed. Not that it matters, now.” She kneeled down and interlocked her
    fingers, murmuring in hush tones.
    <em>
        “I revere our master, Lady Clotho, for the blessings bestowed upon our
        shelter. Thank you, for masking our presence from enemies within these
        walls, and ensuring our safety on the journey ahead. Inculto.”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Inculto.”</em>
    Artemis repeated, the one-word poem recited by the rest thereafter.
    <em>
        “For it is through our allegiance that Remnant may rest, everlasting.
    </em>
    We’ll have to lay low. Work further beyond the outer rings of the valley,
    and erase whatever pattern the Eidolons think they discovered.”
</p>
<p>
    Eos lumbered to her private garden. “As always. I’ll get to work on masking
our scent with fumes. Which do you want? <em>Alyssum, Jasmine,</em> or    <em>Lavender?”</em>
</p>
<p>
    “How about <em>Amaryllises?”</em> Diana piped up.
</p>
<p>
    “Are you secretly a descendant of Lady Hestia?” Eos joked, audibly proud of
    her own joke.
</p>
<p>
    “Ha! I love your flowers this season, by the way. They’re almost as tall as
    you.”
</p>
<p>
    “Then they’re not tall enough. ‘Tis a shame I must sacrifice them to make
    something as conceited as perfume. Why so vain, Sister Artemis?”
</p>
<p>
    “You must be jesting! It is purely for our <em>safety.</em> Turn back time
    and become the first member, <em>then</em> we’ll talk.”
</p>
<p>
    “Heehee!” Diana couldn’t help herself.
</p>
<p>
    “…Thank you for laughing. Be sure to finish your readings tonight. As for
    you two, after we dine in the banquet, I suspect you’ll join me for
    prayer?” All she received were nods. “Excellent. I’ll see you all at
    supper.” Artemis gave her companions a group hug, then retreated deeper
    into the stronghold.
</p>
<p>
    “Should we help her?” Eleanor questioned Diana.
</p>
<p>
    “Just one thing, first. I did have one question about the next library’s
    lore, if you don’t mind. I know I can’t read ahead, but it seemed important
    given today’s events. How come the Eidolons are becoming more frequent?
    When I was first found by you, I didn’t even know they existed. Then, ever
    since that changed a few years later, it’s like they’re getting smarter.”
</p>
<p>
“Well… For the sake of your safety, I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to spoil    <em>some</em> secrets, given the circumstances.”
</p>
<p>
    “No.” Eos stopped her. “She’s not ready. Just as all of us had, she should
    learn Kingdom Lore in its intended chronology. Those were the orders from
    above.”
</p>
<p>
    “…She’s right. You are to follow the path set before you by Lady Clotho.”
</p>
<p>
    Diana nodded. “I… I understand. My apologies.”
</p>
<p>
    “If you’d want, I can tutor you tonight. The Seventh Generation is one of
    my favorites.”
</p>
<p>
    “I’d like that very much.”
</p>
<p>
    “Allow me some fresh air, then, and I’ll meet you in your quarters.”
    Eleanor opened the main gates to see a pair of cavaliers approaching, both
    somewhat out of breath but satisfied with the work they’d presumably
    accomplished. “Oh! Thank the gods you two are okay! Come, quick. I think
    Artemis is planning to cook up some pheasant!”
</p>
<p>
    “Wow.” One of them, <em>Mania,</em> looked her up and down, witnessing how
    Eleanor’s armor was still caked with black blood and grime. “Finally, an
    outfit worth wearing! About time.”
</p>
<p>
    “Shut up.” Eleanor laughed.
</p>
<p>
    “Woah. What happened to <em>you?”</em> <strong>Styx</strong> followed suit.
</p>
<p>
    “Ha. I promise I’ll tell you <em>all</em> about it after dinner.”
</p>
<p>
    By sundown that same day, the paralyzed Eidolons had busted free of the
    spell by a <em>third</em> rider of similar appearance. Stone flung in every
    direction. The now free Grimm snapped a still convulsing arm into its
    socket, then pulled the last ally out of <em>their</em> coffin itself. A
    series of silent sneers later, and each of the three cracked their horses
    forward, in separate directions.
