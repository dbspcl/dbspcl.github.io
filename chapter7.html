    Selene had taken the rare chance to hone her trade in peace. Even though
    abusing a semblance for combat didn’t allow her to put the perks of dancing
    into practice <i>yet,</i> it was a splendid pastime. Her agile movements
    were rehearsed to excellence, technical in approach, and dazzling above all
    else. If only it could last longer before somebody slipped into the dorm
    rooms. “W-Who are you?” She hopped back at the sight of a forgotten peer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What? It’s me. You know, <i>Terrance.</i> I’m in your class.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh. What are you doing here?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Just looking for someone.” He scanned the environment, although
    considering the size of the dorm room there wasn’t much to miss. The
    closet, however, proved enticing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto joined into the calamity without even knowing it, walking out of the
    wardrobe and steadying her sword at the sight of a stranger. “Who are
    you?!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m <i>Terrance!</i> Does no one seriously remember me!? And as I said,
    I’m on the prowl for somebody missing.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…It’s not me, is it?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Unfortunately for me, not right now. Just an old accomplice of mine. But
    ever since that unfair victory, I’ve been waiting to get even.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What are you talking about?” She asked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The sparring match. Between you and I. You cheated.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, right. I probably forgot because it was such a cake walk.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>“Gargh!</i></b>
    <i> You haven’t a clue who you’re talking to-” </i>
    Terrance broke out in another insane outburst, looking completely unhinged
    until a glimpse at Selene brought him back to reality. He switched back to
    his standard self. “Aha. I mean, it’s clear there’s nobody here! Till next
    time!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Terrance scurried through the front door into an uncharitable and unmoving
    Lucifer. Without any need for further conversation, he trotted around him
    just the same.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Is that coffee!?” Alecto cheered, spotting a lone cup in his hands.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Affirmative.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Can I have it?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Affirmative. But only if you can tell me who that <i>faunus</i> was.” He
    asked. The pair shrugged.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Terrance. Claimed he was looking for someone, then implied he had a bone
    to pick with me. Not that I care, mind you. <i>I’ve</i> always got my back,
    when it comes down to it <i>you’ve</i> always got my back, and if that
    fails we’ve always got Nadia…” Alecto spoke too soon, savoring the taste of
    Lucifer’s gift.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…She’ll come back. Right?” Selene assured.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s been too long. Maybe she’s just testing us. Otherwise, maybe she
    really did leave.” Lucifer didn’t know how to soften the blow, but he had a
    saving grace. “She’s from Mistral, is she not? Sources point to a
    settlement in that direction, led by a patron of the Kingdom no less. If
    she wanted to spend a couple nights anywhere, she’d be
    <i>
        there.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So you’re suggesting Nadia’s hiding out in a village to the east?” Alecto
    sought further clarification.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Affirmative.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Okay. You wouldn’t be telling us this if you didn’t have an open schedule.
    Let’s get going. And when we get there, you’re going to apologize,
    <i>
        affirmative?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We’ll see.” Lucifer opened the door for his two teammates, launching the
    search for the third. A few strides and they were already stopped, the
    stampede of four friends breaking into the hallway and nearly toppling them
    over. Rade, Zara, Beleth, and Lexy all piled outward in that order.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Move!”</i>
    Zara in particular broke away, apparently having been dragged into the
    conflict against her will. Selene noted she was clearly sleeping a moment
    prior, clutching her sheets. A greater mystery was <i>how</i> she ended up
    a part of the pandemonium when her bed was out of the crossfire,
    <i>
        outside.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nothing to be afraid of folks! But hey, don’t let me stop you!” Rade
    squirmed away as well, but rather than retreating back inside, he took
    refuge behind Team Lance and scribbled a quick paragraph into the Fear
    Index. The final two charged down the hallway, Lexy brandishing an ornate
    violin and Beleth gaining ground to reclaim it.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Do I even want to know?” Alecto finished face-palming.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’ll give me questions, I’ll give you answers! For a <i>fee.</i>
    Knowledge for knowledge!” Rade bowed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re right. I <i>don’t</i> want to know. But if you’re offering, we’re
    looking for Nadia. You didn’t spot her, did you? What am I saying? Of
    course you didn’t. <i>I</i> was the last one to see her.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Are fears all you keep in that book?” Lucifer inquired.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yep. But I keep plenty more up here.” Rade pointed to his forehead. “Fire
    away!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We’re going to a city state awaiting to the east, and I don’t know why you
    would, but maybe you know something. I’ve heard the ruler’s from Mistral.
    My research also leads me to believe it’s a town in the sky.” Lucifer
    filled him in, but the last detail caught everyone’s focus, most notably
    Alecto’s.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The sky? Who’d ever heard of a town in the sky?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I can think of
    <i>
        one.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Mellow Crest!?” Rade piped up.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s right. You’re familiar?” Lucifer crossed his arms, impressed with
    the scarecrow’s insight.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “All too much. And that’s right, it does rest in the skies, although it’s
    hardly a simple town! You’d be a fool, although not unfounded, to believe
    you could reach Mellow Crest <i>without</i> a ship. The only path up on
    foot is to climb on these big vines that burrow deep into Remnant! If
    you’ve got a sharp tool like this pitchfork, it’s second nature!” Rade’s
    already overflowed movements sparked with extra excitement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Can’t say this is the first time I’ve seen a flying city, but never one I
    had to scale myself. Although, as Mistral <i>is</i> an ally of Atlas, I
    can’t say I’m surprised to see them steal our ingenuity.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“No, no! I’m sorry to burst your bubble, but Mellow Crest didn’t    <i>copy</i> Atlas, if that’s what you’re insinuating! The aristocrat in
charge came up with the idea on their own! And no, they don’t use that    <i>primitive</i> tech from Atlas, quite the contrary! The masses of Mistral
    are no stranger to all kinds of foreign tools and methods, sometimes it may
    even feel like some form of wizardry…” Everyone looked at him, dumbfounded
    at the rant. “Okay, you got me. It’s wizardry. If I wasn’t so busy, I’d
    really venture to tag along! It’s been awhile. But… I have my hands full
    here.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “This is a personal mission anyway. But you have my thanks. Anything else
    we should know?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Nadda!</i>
    But do me a solid, please. If you run into Mellow Crest’s Baroness, tell
    her I said hello.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If we see her, we will.” Alecto felt it was due in return for the help.
    Nothing of any real consequence stopped them after that, safe for a bushel
    of meadows and lengthy rocky inclines. At one point the flashes of
    lightning over a gray cluster of cliffs captured Alecto’s attention.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Wouldn’t we need to pass through Summit’s Blight to reach Mistral?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We’re not going to Mistral, remember? It’s a branch thereof. While the
Blight takes up a great hemisphere of Sanus and holds both the detestable    <i>White Fang</i> along with, <i>ahem,</i> <b>other</b> individuals, Mellow
    Crest is well out of its reach- <i>north</i> of the mountains.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You <i>really</i> don’t like the White Fang, do you?” Alecto interrogated,
    not realizing the shivers she inflicted upon Selene with the mention of
    their name. “There’s a prominent group in Remnant’s history known as the
    Old Fang, but experience shows they’re not the same. What is it about them
    that’s so terrible? They just seem like a militia group to me.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I find the issue trivial, although as evident from our current
    circumstances not everyone agrees. All <i>I’ve</i> ever known of the White
    Fang is misery. Clearly Nadia’s seen this so-called <i>other</i> side of
    the coin. I’m still not convinced it exists.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “They target humans, least that’s what I’ve been told, and more or less
    experienced myself. My only run in with them was our first adventure in
    Summit’s Blight, but were we faunus would the White Fang have stopped us? I
    don’t recall them mentioning anything about humans.” Alecto said.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Are you likening what we’ve faced to a splinter group? Say what you will,
    at most everyone agrees the White Fang commits great transgressions against
    humans. If you’re somehow suggesting <i>‘Herald’</i> and his men weren’t
    among them, some evidence would go a long way for me.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Selene cut in. “I didn’t know Nadia felt so strongly about this. I didn’t
    know <i>anyone</i> could. The… White Fang, to me and Lucifer, is the cause
    of a terrible war our lands endured. I thought there’d be less here, but…”
    She paused, losing her train of thought. Merlin skittered into her arms for
    mutual comfort.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m just saying, as an outsider the only vibe I got from them was a need
to protect their territory. I’d probably be more on board with you if    <i>Nadia</i> wasn’t playing the odds.” Alecto reasoned.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That won’t last if we don’t find her.” Lucifer got them back on track just
    in time to see the now iconic trio of vines. Snuggled amidst a glorious
    valley caked with roses, sun flowers, and perfect grass were the three
    massive strings that acted as chain links, currently entombed from the
    clouds into the feat of nature. Each one formulated a broad triangle in
    accordance with the domain’s edges, although they all reconvened in the
    center, fading into the white puffs. The perimeter of the landscape was
    sealed with waterfalls and cliffs, although none reached this sky-fortress.
    A fair few waterfalls cascaded from the kingdom itself.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Woah…” Nadia and Alecto alike, and not to the contrast of their friends,
    were justifiably impressed with the spectacle. Even the peaks of the city’s
    structures were a thing to marvel at despite being barely visible.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If you think this is impressive, you should see the view up north.”
    Lucifer said.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s still really nice, though.” Selene shook her head. “There’s so much
    snow back in Atlas, nothing like this. It’s hard to pick a favorite.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What, you’re telling me Atlas flies in the air?” Alecto snorted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You don’t know the half of it.” Her team leader had a smug inflection.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Whatever. No killer forests, maze mountains, or police states. Just a
    nice, safe haven.” Alecto let out a long winded sigh.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m hoping you’re right. Let’s get in there and find out.” Lucifer set an
    example by galloping down the fields. Without needing any command, Alecto
    bound onto the first clump of briar, gaining purchase with her blade.
    Falling brought a real risk of tumbling into the craters which housed the
    footholds.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer followed the smart strategy, but his free hand was available to be
    held out. Selene paused, gulped, and then followed his signal. She jumped
    over the relatively small hole, and Lucifer took care of the rest. He
    grabbed her hand and guided her onto his back with one slick movement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hold on, right? Just like we practiced.” He appointed, grabbing ahold of
    his cape and tossing it around to envelop Selene.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Right. You know I’ve never been scared of heights, silly!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Although they were technically trespassing, Mellow Crest didn’t seem to
    mind. Especially upon entering the City of Tears, it was clear Team Lance
    and their mascot <i>Merlin</i> were more than welcome. Certainly it was an
    odd sight to see four travelers crawl over the enlarged branches into the
    center of the urban dominion, but as long as they didn’t present a threat
    nobody challenged it. Visitors were common after all, and seldom cast away.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Where do we start? This place is really pretty! No wonder Nadia would hide
    out here.” Selene dusted off her dress.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We could just start asking the civilians.” Alecto raised her mask,
    comprehending the unlikely chance of a combat situation in as serene a
    province as this one. They took to her suggestion, tolerating the strange
    but understandable glances or pauses that came forth when someone was
    questioned. “Does this place actually get much traffic? As we’ve seen it’s
    sort of… off the beaten path, shall we say?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “As Rade made clear, the use of a bullhead, or dropship would help. Or,
    perhaps it’s an isolated state. We made it up here without much contention
    from neither the elements nor the populous. Do you really think that’s an
    anomaly?” Lucifer ranted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It could be, how am I supposed to know?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, look! Maybe he knows!” Selene pointed at a familiar face down the
    road. He couldn’t be missed, with his sheets of leather and tendency to
    release a macabre ambience wherever he stood.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Boreas!?” Lucifer repeated himself upon reaching the junction.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hmm? Ah, Team Lance. Well, most of them, anyway. How did you find Mellow
    Crest?” Team Burnt’s leader only drew his eyes off the Beryl Rhinestone for
    a moment, but soon paid full respect by addressing his friends in full.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Pretty much for that reason. We were hoping Nadia was here. Did you see
    her?” Alecto answered.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Unfortunately no. Still missing, is she? A real shame indeed. But you’ll
    find her. If anyone could, it’d you three.” His response prompted Merlin to
    stomp his feet in a tizzy. <i>“Four</i>, rather. Excuse me, as you’ve
    broached I’m here on research affairs. Baroness <i>Miku,</i> I was hoping,
    would have some insight into the Rhinestone’s connection with Summit’s
    Blight. I was mistaken.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Miku?</i>
    Who’s that?” Selene said.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It must be this ruler we’ve heard so much about.” Lucifer caught on
    quickly. “Where is she?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’d ran into her at <i>Town’s Square.</i> You’ll find it’s easily seen.”
    He raised his hand to the heavens, pointing out the tallest spire.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Got it.” Everyone but the alchemist migrated to the Clock Tower.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We’d stay and chat, but we’re on a mission. Sorry.” Alecto stayed behind
    to pat Boreas on the shoulder. Although considering his height, she could
    barely reach.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t be. We’re all caught up in work these days, myself included. Go.
    Find Nadia, and when you do, make it clear we’re <i>all</i> waiting for her
    return.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto nodded and ran to catch up with the caravan. A series of detours
    revealed how lost she really was.
    <i>
        “H-How did I lose them!?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Contrary to the bristling positivity and high energy provided by the city,
    Grimm <i>were</i> here. They had somehow seeped through the cracks of
defense, allowed to fester out of public view to create admittedly    <i>low</i> numbers. No real threat for the knight, rather a nuisance. She
    was excited to put Grimm of any type or number in their place.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A sprinkle of young Grimm were far too easy. Taking advantage of the
    sanctuary and intelligence that came with old age, a moderately powerful
    Boarbatusk swept itself into the brawl with full intent to do away with the
    invader.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’ve never seen a clock tower double as a <i>bell tower.</i> Where are all
    the mechanical parts?” Selene was occupied with the real task at hand, now
    waiting in the landmark with everyone but Alecto.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The plaque here says there <i>are</i> no internals, that somehow the clock
    is kept in motion by command of the Baroness. The same could be said of the
    entire city. How poetic. She keeps both time <i>and</i> space in order.”
    Lucifer summarized the text.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “She’s really powerful enough to keep Mellow Crest floating in the air?
    What about when she’s sleeping?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“I’m not sure. More puzzling is the idea of her citizens moderating    <i>themselves.</i> Is she the only enforcer here?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A complete stranger intervened. “Well, sort of. The denizens here are no
    different from those in Mistral, or Vale for that matter. They’re good
    people, and they understand that with protections and compassion,
    contentment must be traded.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So there’s no police. But there <i>is</i> an entity willing to drop
    everyone at the first sign of dissent. That makes it <i>fear</i> based,
    does it not?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Quite the contrary! I would <i>never</i> do anything to hurt the
    townspeople.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“’I’?</i>
    You’re the Baroness!?” Nothing ever slipped past Lucifer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Please, call me Skyler. It’s a pleasure to formerly meet you! You’re from
    Atlas, are you not?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Affirmative.” He shook her hand.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “And you must be?” Skyler leaned down, smiling.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Miss Selene Virtus!” She giggled.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Selene <i>Virtus.</i> Ah, I see. It’s an honor to meet you <i>both. </i>
    Did anyone else come with you?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The double doors made way as Alecto, along with her polar opposite, barged
    inside without regard for the inhabitants or their architecture. Seeing as
    it was the only option, her sword was jammed in the armored back of the
    Boarbatusk, and without any way to control it, the Grimm was headed
    straight at Skyler.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    ‘Gah!” Alecto and her sword lost their hold on the steed and flew into a
    wall. The Boarbatusk was forced to halt, Skyler taking matter into her own
    hands. An arcane staff warped into her hand. Making use of such a tool
    allowed her to freeze, levitate, and <i>lob</i> the foe out the front door.
    Casting <i>Boarbatusks</i> out of her domain seemed effortless so long as
    she wielded the constellation-riddled cane. “S-Sorry!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Woah! Where did you get that?” Selene buzzed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I made it. It took me awhile though. Wanna see? There’s a great story to
    go with it, actually. Remind me to tell you some other time. Surely you
    didn’t come to Mellow Crest just to hear me talk about myself, right? What
    business do you have here?” She passed her weapon down to the teenager.
    While Selene was busy examining the artifact, her pals revealed the details
    of their quest.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We’re looking for a young girl named Nadia. She always wears a blue hood
    and cape. You’d know her if you saw her. Only problem is… you wouldn’t see
    her.” Lucifer began to realize how difficult it was to find the ultimate
    rogue in a haystack the size of Vale, let alone Remnant.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Why’s that? Has she gone missing?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well, sort of. She knows exactly where she is, I hope. Because she didn’t
    get lost, she just… <i>ran away.”</i> Alecto said, glaring at Lucifer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ugh. We’re <i>never</i> going to find her. If she doesn’t want to be
    found, she <i>won’t</i> be found. She could be five feet in front of us,
    and we wouldn’t know.” He deplored.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “This Nadia’s pretty stealthy, is she? Where did she learn that from?”
    Skyler reclaimed her wooden scepter.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I can only assume she was trained in Mistral, but she’s been our teammate
    from Beacon Academy as long as I’ve known her.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re from Beacon!? M-My apologies, it just seemed to me you lot were
    more… I-I thought you were from
    <i>
        Atlas.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Selene puffed her cheeks. “We enrolled at the start of this semester, to
    learn how to fight, and kill those big scary monsters!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Now you’re talkin’ my language.” Alecto laughed. Skyler herself couldn’t
    help a few gleeful chuckles.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If you’re from Beacon, that means you may have met-“
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “W-What’s that orange storm over there?” Selene felt it necessary to inject
    herself in the conversation. It was clear what she was referring to,
    although it wasn’t as much a storm as it simply <i>looked</i> like one. In
    truth, the distant atmosphere was so polluted that the sky itself had
    turned gray, and red. Like an ugly sunset. Amidst the smog that settled
    among the clouds were a few silhouettes of skyscrapers.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’ve been wondering that myself. Only in the past week or so has it
    appeared.” Skyler looked to the stars in thought. The bloody speck over the
    mountains was so far she didn’t realize the gravity of its presence.
    <br/>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What?! <i>Is that…?”</i> Alecto put the pieces together, having visited
    the nation once herself.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Servus Portum!?” Lucifer gasped. There was no mistaking it. The slow
    moving walls, the Kingdoms turning their backs, the <i>Purifiers</i>
    investigating Summit’s Blight, and Caligula’s promises of purification- It
    all made sense now. Servus Portum was ever expanding.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Servus Portum.” Skyler repeated, processing the name. “Should I be
    worried? My strict apologies, as an isolationist I care little for the
    affairs of fellow neighbors.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“This one’s a tyrant with a lust for despotism. If he inches closer, I    <i>would</i> be concerned. That mystical polearm inspires confidence, but
    can it take on a whole armada, and double the number of comrades?” Lucifer
    didn’t hold back.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s not going to get to that point. I’ll speak to Servus Portum’s Ruler
    if he falls over the hills. The grasslands of Mellow Crest have remained
    untouched for a very long time. I’d very much appreciate if it stayed that
    way.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Their<i> ‘Supreme Leader’ </i>is not open to negotiations, I’m afraid.
    Fortunately, you’ve got plenty of time to change his mind.” Lucifer was
    well-versed in the whims of war.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m a people person, and I’ve been a prized diplomat for a <i>very</i>
    long time. I’m sure I can reach him. I’d be more concerned about your
    friend, truth be told. She didn’t go <i>there,</i> did she?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Not a chance.” Alecto scoffed. “Nadia’s too good to get snuffed out by    <i>them.</i> No, if anything could catch her off guard, it’d be surprise
    Grimm. <i>Hmph,</i> as if. Good riddance to any disgusting creature who
    tries.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We better find her quick, then. She’s not here, but if she pops up, I’ll
    tell her you guys are looking for her. If Mellow Crest didn’t need me, I’d
    take her to Beacon myself…” Skyler looked away, a sad innocence filling the
    air. “Maybe at some point you four could hold the fort for me. I’d love to
    travel to Vale’s Academy sometime.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Once we find Nadia, we can all come back here! She would love to meet
    you.” Selene consoled.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Leave now, and there’s a better chance that’ll happen. We should get back
    on track.” Lucifer would have preferred staying, but they weren’t in here
    on a holiday. If Nadia wasn’t nearby, there wasn’t any real reason for them
    to be either. “I can’t think of anywhere she’d be, though.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Maybe we could check a few smaller towns on the way back. Do you think she
    could already be gone?” Selene felt a great weight in asking such a thing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No.” Lucifer left it that, setting an example by trampling out of the
    historic settlement and towards midtown, where the binding vines were
    locked. Skyler waved bye as everyone else did the same. The way back was a
    mystery to Alecto thanks to her strange Grimm-filled route. A garden with a
    clear view of Remnant dared to be the only distraction, especially since
    Boreas had set up shop in the botanical attraction.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No luck, I take it? We’re <i>both</i> stuck in a bind then. I’d finally
    get some accurate measurements if Summit’s Blight ceased these roars. The
    vibrations, shockingly, can be felt from here, and they’re tampering with
    my calculations. The Beryl Rhinestone <i>must</i> be stable for this to
    work, and with every shout it becomes more unruly.” Boreas figured Nadia
    would be with them at this point if she was found. Most of his attention
    was on a nearby golden telescope outfitted with trinkets and levers.
    Sitting in a hopper and jolting this way and that awaited the gem.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Haven’t found a clue on this thing yet, have you? What makes you think
    it’s so powerful? My lien’s on it being a ridiculous waste of time.”
    Lucifer said. At hearing this, the Rhinestone ripped itself out of the cage
    and rapidly rolled away.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“No! Get that <b>Stone!”</b></i>
    Boreas screamed, watching it prance past everyone. Alecto, not familiar
    with its power, lunged for it nonetheless just to land hard without gaining
    anything. Selene wasn’t up to chase, let alone jump, but <i>Merlin</i>
    picked up the slack.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    While everyone ran but failed to catch up, Merlin was right on the
    Rhinestone’s heels. Their race endured winding roads, twisting bridges, and
    several shortcuts through rivers. Onlookers were mortified at seeing a
    battalion of armed contenders charge after a bunny, who was in turn locking
    down a purple pearl.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Finally, Merlin caught it. All he had to do was spring out of Mellow Crest
    and slide down the trail of vines that served as an exit with as little
    grace as possible. Everyone but Boreas followed as he believed anything
    more than <i>four</i> runners a recipe for failure. Skyler, privy to
    everything taking place in her sanctum, joined him.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How exciting! I couldn’t be more pleased to see the antics of Beacon so
    contagiously well-spirited.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If the Rhinestone wasn’t so integral to solving Remnant, I’d be more at
    ease with it hanging in the balance.” Boreas stroked his chin. “It has a
    will of its own, reacts to the shrieks of Grimm, holds an unmatched sense
    of power, and I’ve been told it can open seals within Summit’s Blight.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Really? Can’t say I blame you for being so enamored with it, then. Go get
    ‘em.” Skyler smirked. Boreas did as commanded.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Merlin! Are you okay?” Selene, upon being released from Lucifer, scanned
    the tall grass. She knew her friend could survive a fall even if he missed
    the landing, the question was where he <i>was,</i> or if the Rhinestone did
    anything to him.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Merlin. Where are you!?” Lucifer repeated her chant, but with his own
    militant tone. Fearing the possibility of an assault, Alecto assumed a
    defensive posture. The panic didn’t appear to be well-founded. Merlin,
    Rhinestone in paw, jumped high into the sunlight and landed in Selene’s
    arms.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Gotcha!” She hugged him intimately. The stone whipped itself out of their
    grasp right into Boreas’s hand.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Excellent work. I should bring <i>Merlin</i> with me on my travels. He
    captures this damn thing better than anyone else.” He admired.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well, there might be <i>one</i> other who has us beat.” Selene turned to
    Summit’s Blight, smiling nervously.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Okay. We’re done in Mellow Crest, and we’ve got your little toy.” Lucifer
    groaned. “We should be heading back, now.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If you keep insulting it, you won’t just have <i>me</i> to deal with.
    You’ve already seen the kind of havoc the Rhinestone can inflict.” Boreas
    said.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m not too worried. <i>Not too worried.”</i> With every order of business
    now at an end, Boreas and Lucifer lead the party as team leaders. The trip
    back was as demanding now as it was in reverse. But their work was not
    done, as almost immediately they were situated in an arena perfect for
    another session of semblance training.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Now, you’ve gotten better, there’s no question. These portals don’t seem
    nearly as taxing as they were when we started, right?” Alecto coached.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Right.” Selene nodded.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “See? You can even talk while doing it!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hey! No fair! You’ve had your semblance for a lot longer than I have!” Her
    earnest outburst was all in good fun. “I wish I could turn things into
    little balls and hit them!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I wouldn’t say that. We haven’t even <i>begun</i> to tap into the
    potential of your semblance, and I’m guessing it’s going to be a real
    winner once we’re done.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Can you use your semblance on
    <i>
        people?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Sure. That’s what it’s meant for. There’s only so many chairs I can slice
    in two, y’know?” Alecto spun her beloved short sword, taking solace in its
    presence.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Can you trap enemies in the globe for as long as you want?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “They’ll break out themselves, eventually. I’m not sure what it’s like-
    I’ve never used it on <i>myself.</i> It might be a force of will issue.
    Maybe… I could test it on <i>you.”</i> Alecto made a subtle move, looking
    to the ceiling directly at a baroque light fixture. Something changed her
    mind. “N-Never mind. Bad idea.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re right! We need to get to work, we’ve been sitting here talking too
    much.” Selene caressed her braids.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Not at all! Notice, this entire time <i>you’ve kept this portal going.</i>
    Keep it up, the more we stretch and sustain your skill the better you’ll
    get. It’s like a muscle, only we can’t <i>pull</i> this one. Now, if only
    we could get something <i>out</i> of this portal.” The hellish doorway
    being referred to was, as usual, a horizontal void filled with whirling
    lavender clouds. It formed a limitless hole in the floor.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Watch out! You might fall in!” Selene cried out.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We’ll see. Something tells me…” Alecto reached forward into the gate to
    confirm her clawed gloves could not breach the mists. A mythical force kept
anything from mixing inside. “Aha! Nothing is allowed in there. I probably    <i>can’t</i> fall in, but if I did, would it act like a trampoline or a
    pool?” Alecto finally posed a question to Selene. She succeeded greatly in
    distracting the young empress.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hmmm…” She considered the possibilities while, directly above her, a force
    unknown cut the cords holding one of the many lamp fixtures. Lucifer, with
    the help of a durable lantern, crashed down mere feet from her location.
    <b>
        <i>
            “Ahh!”
            <p>
            </p>
        </i>
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    In her panic and sudden sense of danger, she tensed on reaction, and from a
    portal a single <i>skeletal arm</i> was levitated into the air. It landed
    with a bony crunch. Every dry, skinless finger stayed connected despite no
    evidence of ligaments.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Really!? A skeleton hand?”</i>
    Alecto picked it up in disbelief.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “L-Lucifer!? What’s the big idea?” Selene shrieked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-I’m sorry!” He couldn’t help but laugh, retracting his mask. “Please,
    forgive me. You were never in any real danger, I had complete control.
    Trust me.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Guys? Look at this.” Alecto approached with the terrifying appendage.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Were you <i>waiting</i> up there to scare me? <i>Why? </i>Are you crazy?”
    Selene seemed to be berating him out of embarrassment at this point more so
    than genuine distress.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Alecto and I thought you were ready to step it up. After so many tries at
    this, she was convinced that, as long as you could maintain the portal, a
    little fear would prompt an impulsive response. That’s how <i>she</i>
    learned.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Guys! You won’t believe this!” Alecto tried again.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “S-So you two set me up thinking that if you almost dropped a light on me,
    I’d magically summon a beast or something?” Selene squawked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“It didn’t <i>almost</i> drop on you- I made sure of that. You know I would    <b>never</b> do anything to harm you.” He justified. Alecto gave up, waving
    the spectral arm in front of him.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hello!? Look!” She patted his chest with it a few times, to his disgust.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“What the devil!?</i>
” He swatted it away.    <i>“Are you insane? Where did you find that thing!?”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Selene summoned it, airhead. Our plan worked!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “W-What!?” Lucifer was twice as shocked as he looked a few seconds prior.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Me? I</i>
    summoned a <i>skeleton hand?”</i> The thought produced a combo of fright
    and excitement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yep! Want to take a look?” Alecto held the limb down for a sort of
    gruesome peace offering. Selene paused, completely entranced with the
    bones. Even Merlin tilted his head, happy for her. It was amusing how such
    a grisly, mundane object could produce such awe. Then, without warning,
    Selene snatched it away and bolted out of the training hall.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“…Yay! I summoned a skeleton hand! I summoned a skeleton hand!”</i>
    She chanted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We… should really go take that thing away from her before she gets in
    trouble.” Alecto brought up a reasonable proposal.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Affirmative.” The soldier, his teammate, and the pet bunny broke into a
    sprint. Their new task was to reel in Selene, and prep her for greater
    milestones. A dead, static fragment of a skeleton <i>had</i> to be the
    beginning of something greater. It was her burden to figure out what.
