    Summit’s Blight was cruel. It was unforgiving. It was bitterly <i>cold.</i>
    Nomad <i>wasn’t,</i> even as the temperatures continued to plummet. The
    mountains showed mercy this day, sparing him a flood of rain. Of upmost
    concern was keeping the package dry, for in Nomad’s arms and under Idol’s
    Cloak was a folded container. Its contents were to be kept hidden.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A righteous Griffon silently swerved through the clouds above and dropped
    its rider. <b>Nobody</b> descended soft on his feet, enduring the fall with
    quiet, smooth precision. <i>“Deer!”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nomad turned, his eyes widening at the sight. Utterly shocked, he tumbled
to the floor, his box being cushioned by the coat. Unfortunately,    <i>his</i> landing wasn’t as charitable. “<i>What!?</i> Impossible! A-A
    Delphic lives?” His vision folded in on itself, and he began choking. This
    meltdown lasted only a moment before Nobody sauntered over and heaved him
    up, laughing at the display of weakness.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Get on your feet, <b>Deer.</b> Enough of this. As much as I’m tempted
        to slay you here and now, I’ll keep those urges to myself.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
Nomad broke out of his grip, now refreshed, his bearings acquired anew.<i> “Can it really be? A <b>Delphic?</b></i> I’d heard of a    <i>Grimm Tactician</i> waging war with the red forest. I’m just shocked to
    learn it’s all true. Too often are tales of madmen and legends little more
    than fodder for the fireplace.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Indeed. A similar story came upon myself-
    word of a <i>cloaked deer</i> tearing down massive spider-grimm in the
sorrowful Summit’s Blight. And now, I stand in the presence of that    <i>Cursed Faunus.</i> Is that an issue?” He placed a hand on the handle of
    his blade and advanced.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No.” Nomad wasn’t concerned with his own safety, <i>that</i> much could be
    deduced from the way he quickly shifted to protect the <i>box,</i> whatever
    may be inside. Nobody was tuned into this fact. “Not <i>yet,</i> anyway.
    And I was not alone when Galathyn perished. But enough talk about that
    terrible night. Tell me your
    <i>
        name.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You first.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>“No.”</i></b>
    Nomad stood slightly taller than the newcomer, and became pitiless in his
    wording.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Then I am Nobody.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well then, tell me this. What brings a Delphic, who had previously been
    attracting a fair bit of attention on the outskirts of Vale, to Summit’s
    Blight?” Nomad sought to steal whatever scraps of information he could from
    Nobody while their introductions were still fresh, their relationship in
    its infancy.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“That bane is not carried by you. Those are reasons kept only for    <i>me.</i> You don’t own these mountains… But then, if that’s true, why are
    you here? <i>What are you looking for?” </i>Nobody asked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“You’re watching me. You’re watching <i>everyone.</i> You have    <b>insatiable</b> hunger for knowledge, and an <i>unbearable</i> love of
    secrecy. It seems not even this place is exempt from enemy ears. There are
    intruders everywhere. First the legends of Vale, then the forces of
    Caligula. After that, <b>she</b> sends in <i>the Seer.</i> And now,
    <i>
        you.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nobody adjusted his hat and began preaching to the skies. “One of those is
not like the others. I’ll keep you guessing which one. But I’m    <i>impressed.</i> You’ve noticed the <i>‘Seer’ </i>of the <i>Moth.</i>
    That’s the only noteworthy contender here besides you and the White Fang.
    And, it’s the reason I <i>left</i> Forever Fall- to keep under her radar.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The Moth. Is that what you call her?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “With pleasure. And <i>it</i> beckons.” Nobody’s smile stretched further
    than usual.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Who</i>
    beckons?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“The <b>Moth</b> beckons.”</i>
    He sneered. “And if they get their way, Remnant will fall. Nothing will be
    left.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nomad looked back at the cardboard crate, sadness seeping past his usually
    suppressive visage.
    <i>
        “All that matters… Is what I have lost.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“…Hahaha! </i>
    You and I are one and the same in that regard. I hope you have eyes in the
    back of your head, because danger is lurking. There is much to fear,
    including <b>me.</b> The next time we meet, I’d hate to find you dead.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Not like it would change anything.” Nomad grumbled, watching Nobody call
    his Griffon and casually dip off the edge of a notable cliff. The Delphic
    caught his monstrous flying counterpart, and returned to the clouds above.
    Picking up the box and reflecting on his situation, Nomad couldn’t help but
    appreciate his surroundings. Leaving Summit’s Blight was a task few could
    accomplish with such ease, and now the sun shone through whatever mist
    lingered, foliage eating up what was previously barren rock.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Upon the crag, alongside the ocean, the monument titled <i>“Zenith”</i>
    awaited. A mournful prayer came with Nomad’s return here, and past the
    bridge the house welcomed him back, offering a refuge that could never be
    found otherwise.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This time, not a soul waited inside. He ensured his privacy by locking the
    double doors, sealing him inside a foyer with assorted furniture. There was
    indeed a second floor, though it didn’t seem to captivate him quite like
    the table he set his parcel down on. Finally, a moment of respite. Nomad
    balanced Idol’s Cloak on the back of a dining chair and unfurled the ribbon
    around the package to reveal a
    <i>
        cake.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Happy birthday. I, <i>aha, </i>I got you a cake.” The lack of any real
    person alongside Nomad didn’t stop him from talking. “A good friend of mine
    made it. I made sure it was your favorite, see? Purple! Haha… It was
    nothing. Only the best for you. You deserve it.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Crickets filled in the awkward periods of silence when no response was
    awarded.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How’ve you been? I’ve been doing well, just really busy these days. How
    about I cut you a piece? I was never any good at cutting these, but maybe I
    could give it a try… <i>Aha!</i> There you go!” He took a seat, and placed
a hefty serving on a nearby plate. “Can’t <i>bake</i> the cake, can’t <i>serve</i> the cake. I’m sure you remember, the only thing I ever    <i>could</i> create was the Sweet Regale. It was always <i>her</i>
    favorite. <i>She</i> was the one who invented it. Next time, I’ll make some
    for you. But a cake is the best for <i>birthdays,</i> and I was scared of
    messing everything up.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Waves lapped against the <i>Zenith,</i> the cliff that upheld this mansion
    that so clearly acted as a hideout and tactical retreat for the faunus
    within. More comforting was the echo of those waves.
    <i>
        Magnificent.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I know, me? Scared? It’s unusual. But you know, everyone gets scared
    sometimes. <i>She</i> had a fair few run-ins with fear herself. If only she
    were here, now…” Nomad sighed, cutting himself a slice of cake. Without
    much left to say, he waited, snacking on the treat.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I miss you. I wish things could be different. Every day, I wish. I’m
    sorry, it’s just been <i>difficult.</i> But I’m going to make everything
    right, okay? I know I say that every time, but… I <i>promise</i> this time.
    We’re close to fixing this.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This portrait, of a faunus speaking to himself in the presence of a
    delicious cake, continued for quite some time. It would not be until
    sunrise that he moved from that position, and barely had the sun just taken
    its slumber. When it came to wasting time, though, Nomad’s once-allies were
    a step up. <i>They</i> hadn’t the slightest clue how long they’d been
    trapped in Terra Insanire. Doubtless, they’d witnessed sundown at least
    twice.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “C’mon! You’ve gotta let me come with you! I won’t be in trouble as long as
    Royal and Merlin stay with me.” Selene begged.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “And what if they don’t?” He noticed Merlin’s disapproval, and clarified
    his implications. “Or <i>can’t?</i> We’ve been here too long. Whatever
    conflict Alecto started, it’s swung into full motion, and I can’t see it
    stopping anytime soon. There’s no telling what plots she or Beleth have
    constructed to eliminate each other. I get the unnerving feeling that even
    now, there is duplicity writhing about. Alecto’s barely said a <i>word</i>
    since the incident, and Nadia’s covered her tracks expertly <i>again.</i>
    You haven’t seen either, have you?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“A-All</i>
    I care about is making sure everyone makes it out in one piece.” Selene
    danced around the issue, Lucifer too occupied with the convoluted synopsis
    to detect the lie. “And I’m getting tired of sleeping inside your armor. It
    barely fits, and I know you want me to wear it to keep me warm, but what
    about you? It’s too cold. I can’t stop you from staying up all night, but
    I’d prefer it not happen in <i>this</i> weather! I can manage with just
    your cape. Please, let me help you fix this.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It can’t be done. Your safety is of upmost importance. Have you really
    forgotten our mission so soon?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “N-No! Of course not. Enough. We need to stop this, or Grimm will find us.
    At least we’re not in <i>Summit’s Blight.</i> I can’t see any of us
    surviving overnight there.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “On that, we can agree. Even if both are <i>huge,</i> the Blight is
    probably edging us out at this point, what with its manmade bridges, caves,
    and unending ravines. <i>Forever Fall</i> and the <i>Emerald Forest</i>
    cannot yet begin to compare to the peril offered there. And then, there’s
    the rain. Frankly, I’m surprised there isn’t another Kingdom settled
    there.” Lucifer paused, then began to see the situation from a militaristic
    perspective. Not surprising in the slightest. “Maybe that’s what that
    idiot, <i>Caligula,</i> is after. The mud, along with all the other
    obstacles, would provide plenty of natural defenses, and the perfect
    battlefield. Tactics would be a joy to see there, if <b>I</b> wasn’t always
    the one fighting.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Uh huh. Anything to keep from helping <i>me,</i> huh?” Alecto sighed,
    undetectable, watching in whatever darkness beat out the moonlight. “Very
    well. I’ll do what I must, with or without you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Without revealing her eavesdropping, and periodically looking over her
    shoulder to make sure it wasn’t being used against her by <i>Nadia,</i>
    Alecto resumed her search of Terra Insanire. Beleth wasn’t in the Meridian,
    or the surface. Nor was he at the <i>exit.</i> The most Alecto had seen of
    Team Blazer so far was Rade. Overtime, news of the lost Rhinestone spread,
    thanks to him. The sly fellow bound from traveler to traveler, updating
    everyone before returning to the watchful splinter group consisting of
    Selene, Nadia, Zara, and himself. But since then, he’d vanished.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ay! <i>Ally!”</i> Troy stopped her. Overtime, his habit of randomly
    appearing with his shop had grown bothersome, like an itch that never
    subsided. It only became worse with time.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ugh. Not <i>this,</i> again.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What are you doing at this late hour? Rarely do loyal customers need dust
    so direly that they’d come to me! Aren’t there bazaars back in
    wherever-it-is you’re from?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“They don’t have <i>bazaars.</i> We have <b>stores.</b> This isn’t the    <i>Stone Age,</i> and that’s coming from a historian. Lastly, <i>you</i>
    came to
    <i>
        me.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Bad night, tonight?” Troy spun a bushel of juggling balls on one finger.
    “What happened?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto rested her hands in her face. “I already told you, <b>six</b> times.
    I figured out that Beleth was a Delphic. And so, he must be exiled from
    Remnant, one way or another. That was some couple moon-falls ago.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It was? How am I just now figuring out about this?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Look, I need to do this. Haven’t you taken the hint? How many times do I
    have to tell you? <i>Leave. Me. Alone.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Troy first appeared shocked, genuinely <i>hurt.</i> But that quickly
    devolved into a relentless smirk. “I see. Girl needs a bit of privacy, does
    she? I can do plenty to blow minds, but I can’t <i>read</i> ‘em.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    With his departure, silence was thrilling. But she couldn’t stop moving.
Dedication was all that coerced through her now, the sentiment of taking    <i>bitterly unmerciful revenge</i> a source of gentle comfort. There was,
    however, a strange peace that reeked with melancholy regret. Mostly this
    eerie feeling came upon Alecto when she crossed past a dormant lake, the
    shattered moon reflecting to eclipse her silhouette.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Beleth once again ruined everything for her. Through her paranoia, or rage,
    within the water-formed mirror each of her friends materialized before her,
    ending with the Delphic. Petrified, she stomped the pool, doing away with
    the spirits through calamitous ripples.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “For what you’ve done. For <b>lying</b> to me- I will exact Keraseer
        Justice upon thee.”
    </i>
    She vowed, wiping her face down with the water that previously tormented
    her.
    <i>
        “Gah! What the!?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Frantic hands pulled her away, and forced her into a stupendous tree. Only
    under the branches could Alecto see her pursuer, the ambient glow of red
    emanating from her mask’s slits doing most of the work in that respect.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    It was <i>Lexy.</i> “You’re responsible for all of this! If you hadn’t
    overreacted, we’d still have the Beryl Rhinestone! <i>Why?</i> Why did you
    attack Beleth?! Only I can do that!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
Alecto struggled not to roll her eyes, but she did break away. “He’s a    <i>Delphic.</i> The most vile, villainous trash Remnant’s had to endure
    save for Grimm themselves.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re unbelievable. I’m stuck here, isolated, trying to talk sense into
    someone only concerned with killing their friends. The only way anyone’s
    been able to even eat is bartering with that travelling merchant, Troy. And
yes, <i>barter.</i> Because nobody brought any lien. I’ve already lost    <i>half</i> my rings! And I’m tired of sleeping on the freezing floor. This
    is all your fault, you know?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “My fault? Beleth is to blame. Don’t lecture me. What I want to know is why
    you <i>defended</i> him.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He’s my teammate and best friend! How could I not? It’s true, I knew he
    was a Delphic. <i>Everyone</i> on Team Blazer did. But evidently we had
every reason to hide it. Just look at you now. He <b>trusted</b> us.    <i>Believed</i> in us. He desperately wished he could trust <i>you</i> too.
    Just give him a chance. Then, we can find the Rhinestone and get out of
    here
    <i>
        together.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nonsense. <i>Where’s</i> Beleth?” With all the talk of revenge and
    deception, it was only natural Grimm would arrive in person. <i>Ursas</i>
    were a rarity, especially here, but this must’ve been an unwelcome oddity.
    The creature was especially well equipped. Alecto estimated it to be
    exceptionally old in having garnered <i>this</i> much size and armor.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The two companions quickly aligned motives as soon as the Ursa charged,
    pointless as it was. For a third sword-toting bringer of order lurked out
    of sight. A golden sword, not unlike Alecto’s prized contingency, was
    thrust into the Grimm from behind. With one slick move, it was severed into
    several pieces. Lexy looked past the rapidly disintegrating remains. What
    sort of warrior could effortlessly cut down something <i>that</i> brutishly
    powerful?
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Evaporation broke into a wall of black smoke, which certainly helped the
    theatrics, but it required this newcomer to step forward. Suddenly
    realizing that whoever this was had the strength to do what would’ve taken
    the two of them a great deal to achieve, curiosity melded into terror.

    The voice was that of an angel, and its owner stepped forward to reveal
herself as a gallant knight, cloaked from head to toe in vibrant armor.    <i>“My name is <b>Eleanor.</b> I am merely an ally.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lexy looked over, becoming even more confused when Alecto didn’t share her
    bewilderment.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“I-It cannot be! Do my eyes risk such cruel tricks on me?    <i>Lady Eleanor?”</i> Alecto dropped her sword, and trudged forward.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That armor? And your <i>Aura?”</i> Eleanor seemed equally shocked,
    accepting the oncoming hug. “A Keraseer? Lady
    <i>
        Tisiphone?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “N-No. This is <i>Alecto.”</i> She seemed to recognize that name, and tried
    her hardest to grant it little attention.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Lady <b>Alecto!?</b></i>
    My goodness! May <i>Lady Clotho</i> forgive me, time holds little meaning
    with age. Last I saw you, you were but <i>this</i> tall.” She held her palm
    at about half her own height. “Has it really been <i>that</i> long? Ah,
    pardon me. I shouldn’t pester you with such questions- all that’s important
    is that you’re <i>here.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-It’s a pleasure, Lady Eleanor. Much longer, and I would’ve forgotten
    what you <i>looked</i> like. Much has changed since we last met.” They once
    again held each other close.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “I know.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “This is lovely and all but would you mind, ‘<i>Lady’</i> Alecto,
    explaining who this is? Guess you know each other?” Lexy deduced.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Allow me.” Her new accomplice obliged to introduce herself in full. “I’m
    your sentinel. I am an overseer of our world. I live to keep you, as well
    as all mankind, safe from the creatures of Grimm. I have known Lady
    Alecto’s family bloodline since my birth, and have treasured every Keraseer
    for generations.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How? You can’t be that old.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Remnant is full of surprises.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lexy shrugged. “So your main thing is killing Grimm? Isn’t that every
    Huntress, or Huntsman?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Perhaps. But it had not always been this way. I was once elected
    champion, of the horde that is humanity. They have a choice to make on
    their path, but I’m afraid that as a <i>Silver-Eyed Warrior,</i> it is both
    my privilege and duty to rid Remnant of Grimm till my last breath. Such was
    the will of Lady Clotho, and her coven.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Silver eyes? Silver eyes, yeah?” Lexy was beginning to think she was the
    victim of some sort of bad punchline. “…Who cares about <i>silver eyes?</i>
    I’ve got green eyes. Where’s <i>my</i> trophy?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Eleanor understood this ignorance. It seemed as though this wasn’t the
    first time someone questioned what was considered a mundane attribute, and
    display of vanity. “I am shackled by an oath not to tell. But, as a friend
    of Lady Alecto, maybe she could impart the history of silver eyes. I hope
    she’s been brushing up on Kingdom Lore.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “S-She’s not my friend <i>anymore.”</i> Lexy huffed, remembering her
    current circumstances.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re <i>kidding.</i> Why is that?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto stepped in. “She’s just angry with me because I attacked a Delphic.
    Beleth, he calls himself. ”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Hey!” </i>
    Lexy stomped, her hair flickering with righteous flames. “It’s supposed to
    be a secret!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “A <i>Delphic!?”</i> Eleanor’s voice flared, quivering not with fear or
    apprehension, but the apex of disdain. “You killed him right?
    <i>
        Those aberrations deserve <b>nothing</b> less than painful
        extermination on sight. Not even <b>torture</b> is worth the risk of
        their survival.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Finally, someone who has their <i>head</i> screwed on correctly.” Alecto
    nodded.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lexy’s composure faltered at being outnumbered. <i>“Stop!</i> There’s
    nothing wrong with him! You can’t turn on him because of something so
    trivial!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Except that you attacked Lucifer for no reason, and made him drop the
    Rhinestone. Congratulations, air-head.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“I walked in and saw him fighting Beleth. I find it hard to believe that    <b>my</b> Team Leader attacked first. <i>Yours</i> explodes at the smallest
    of inconveniences. He’s like a broken alarm clock that won’t stop beeping.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Eleanor’s dissatisfaction with the situation, even as an outsider, couldn’t
    be hidden. “Such a shame to see sisters turn on each other. To watch two
    once dearly acquainted colleagues at one other’s necks is a sad affair.
    Humans shouldn’t kill themselves.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t know much about you, but you’re clearly a capable fighter. No
    doubt, you’ve had your hands full with those pesky <i>‘humans.’ </i>Admit
    it, you’ve fought someone before.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Never someone who wasn’t a sister of <i>the Coven.</i> I am not
    permitted to meddle in affairs nary concerning Grimm. I will <i>never</i>
    draw my blade on a human nor faunus. If anything, I was originally here for
    the preservation of Remnant. There is a <i>faunus in red</i> doing terrible
    things, and I must halt his plans, or something <i>unspeakable</i> will
    happen. Though, I thank Lady Alecto for her share of knowledge. I did not
    come here knowing of this Delphic, but now,
    <i>
        I am only here to slay it.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“You’ll never beat him!”</i>
    Lexy said.
    <i>
        “He has a pure heart, no matter what you two say! You won’t fight
        humans? Better walk away now, then, because I will perish before I let
        him die!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>“Not. Likely.” </i></b>
    These words sent a wave a dread across the channel, partly due to the
    mystery of who said it. Eleanor, Alecto, and Lexy all looked over at the
    first sign of a sleuth. Heavy, rubbery footsteps signaled an approach.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>Boreas? Impossible.</i>
    Entry or exit was out of the question, so long as the Rhinestone was
    missing. Lexy rubbed her eyes to make sure she was seeing right, whilst
    Alecto spoke for her. “Boreas! Why are you here? <i>How</i> are you here?
    You don’t have the stone, do you?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So it <i>was</i> lost.” He sounded more quaint than distraught. “Sorry to
    disappoint, but it eludes even me. But not to worry, I am here to help.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “But how did you-”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“I know, I know.</i>
How’d I get here? I figured there was something amiss when Team Lance    <i>and</i> Blazer went missing on the same night, and obviously the
    Rhinestone had something to do with it. There was a small, but serviceable
    amount of energy from the Rhinestone lingering on my equipment. I had to
    use the last of it stored inside, and almost nothing came of it. Let me
    clarify.
    <i>
Within the confines of reality, there is now no method of leaving        <b>or</b> entering Terra Insanire.
    </i>
    That’s why I brought this!” He hauled a rocket-propelled locker off of his
    shoulder, embedding it into the ground.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What’s the point?” Lexy berated him. “You could’ve come here with
    assistance! All we need is an army of extra eyes to help us look!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b>“I</b>
    am here to find the Rhinestone. Nobody knows it better than me, and there’s
nearly a semester of research and notes to back that up. A band of    <i>‘helpers’</i> would only slow me down. Besides, <b>think.</b> I had to
    move fast, and bringing more people into this labyrinth without any
    contingency in the event we <i>truly</i> cannot find the stone is be a
    great way to kill us. <i>All</i> of us.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    There were no faults in his plan that Alecto or Lexy could see <i>yet.</i>
    Patting his hand against the metal tube made for carrying weapons, he
    continued. “I’ve done all I can. With <i>this,</i> it’ll be easy for one of
    us to leave, just this once. Maybe <i>they</i> can think of something on
    the outside, but I’m the best choice for actually <i>finding</i> the
    instrument of our departure.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Lady Alecto? You’re stuck here?” Eleanor began to understand, although not
    quite fully.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-I’ll explain everything. Just follow me.” She sought to recite the
    events of the past few days without the interruptions of Lexy, and left
    both her and Boreas behind.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If I may.” He stalled. “Who do I have the pleasure of meeting this
    afternoon? My name is <i>Boreas.</i> I am the leader of <b>Team Burnt,</b>
    and a good friend of Alecto.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Eleanor.” She was beyond shaking hands, and Boreas wasn’t legendary enough
    to solicit kneeling. Thus, she simply waved. “My purpose is to travel these
    lands, and rid them of Grimm. It fills me with unyielding happiness to find
    others pursuing the same path. Just <i>seeing</i> Lady Alecto has uplifted
    my spirits for the next hundred moons. Like you, I share a special bond
    with her.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Thank you, Lady Eleanor.” Alecto had a hint of rekindled joy somewhere in
    the recesses of that statement. Though, her quick departure with Eleanor
    diminished any hope of her giving up the battle against Beleth.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“’Lady’</i>
    Alecto? Just as I theorized.” Boreas turned to Lexy. “Without question,
    there is a fair bit about her past that’s been kept from us. That reeks of
    royalty, does it not? Though, there are few equipped with plating and
    weaponry that shines so bright, so that’s not <i>really</i> a surprise, is
    it?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Huh. I always just assumed she found that outfit, or maybe she made it at
    whatever Academy accepted her. Pretty arrogant if that’s the case, though.
    Eleanor’s a different story. There’s something… <i>off</i> about that duo.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m inclined to agree. <i>Now,</i> would you mind updating me on what’s
    going on?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lexy did as asked by Boreas, meanwhile a similar conversation took place
    between the new partnerships of knights. But that recap was far less
    forgiving of Beleth, with plenty of hyperbole and the perfect amount of
    teeth clenching. “…And now, we’re imprisoned here.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I see. So, you all <i>know</i> of the Beryl Rhinestone? Impressive. I
    should’ve expected nothing less from a Keraseer. It is crucial we get it
    back, not only for your wellbeing, but for <b>everyone.</b> That’s part of
    why I’m here, actually. Items of that sort are
    <i>
        wicked.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Thank you. But I’m a bit confused about one thing. If I had the stone this
entire time, how did you get in here? Maybe how <i>you</i> entered is how    <i>we</i> exit! Do you have something that can open the door?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nothing that simple, I’m afraid. I may have explained this to you once
    before, when you were but a child, but we both know <i>those</i> days are
long past. My magic is potent, but limited. All members of    <i>Clotho’s Coven</i> are allowed to rest <b>one</b> night of the month,
    when the moon finishes its cycle. Nothing more. That alone gives us the
    strength to fight until the next new moon. And <i>when</i> the moon- the
    mark of darkness, is born anew, no matter where I rest, I will wake up in
    my home- the <b>Heart of the Coven.”</b> Eleanor stood at a vantage point
    where the shattered orb was easily seen enveloping a large portion of the
    sky. “Now you understand, yes? I came here with hopes of finding the
    Rhinestone, but if I cannot, I will be taken to my bed in a month’s time.
    Less, even. If you’ll recall from Kingdom Lore, this privilege is
    complementary to <i>all</i> members of Clotho’s Coven. I have her Majesty
    to thank, and I often do.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Huh. Yeah, that must’ve slipped my mind at some point. There’s lots to
    keep track of, as you know. So let me get this straight. You, as well as
    any <i>Coven</i> devotee, have a way out of here. I bet Summit’s Blight
    isn’t any problem for you, either. But how did you make it here in the
    first place?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I climbed, believe it or not. There was an opening in a cove.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That must be the Meridian! Me and Team Lance have been there many times.
    Did it have a sweet view?” Eleanor nodded. “Alright! But how? Climbing up
    is impossible, we’ve tried. The walls are too slippery, and there’s no
    footholds.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I suppose I <i>could</i> reveal my tricks, to celebrate our coming
    together. The secret’s in my <i>blade.”</i> She held it out.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Woah! I almost forgot! That’s the ancient sword <b><i>Tormentyst!”</i></b>
    Alecto went pale at witnessing the famed artifact in person, only
    fragmented memories of it previously lingering since their last reunion.
    “That’s <i>so</i> awesome! Selene would love this, even if she can’t use
    it.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Few can. Few are <i>allowed.</i> But you’re always welcome to try. See
    that big tree? Take a swing.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Yay!”</i>
    Alecto jittered with excitement. Savoring the feel of the handle,
    appreciating its perfect artistry and metal work, she was given goosebumps.
    Her attack didn’t do much, but it still administered a deep slice that
    would’ve put any Grimm into critical condition.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Perfect form! And a respectable cut, too. Most are not even fit to    <i>scratch</i> it. Can’t say I’m surprised, but here’s where the twist
    comes.” Eleanor retrieved <i>Tormentyst</i> and gave a half-hearted swing
    that was more like a limp putt in comparison to what Alecto had wrought
with every ounce of her courage and confidence on full display as <i>this</i> sword was something very few ever had a chance to even    <i>glimpse.</i> The tree was halved. “Poor thing. It had so much life left
    to live.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Wow! How’d you do that?” Alecto clapped.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I didn’t. Tormentyst did. Bestowed by Lady Clotho, it gauges how pure a
    soul its bearer holds, and will adjust accordingly. For most humans, it
    acts as little more than a club. For silver-eyed warriors, it’s even more
    effective. Then comes you, a <i>Keraseer.</i> And at the end, members of
    the Coven can use it to its <b>full</b> potential.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, I get it! You climbed up by stabbing Tormentyst into the mountain,
    then using it as needed. If anyone else tried it, the metal would just
    bounce off… How about you climb down, then come back, and let us tag along
    one-by-one?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Eleanor took a seat on the severed log, then used it as a makeshift bed.
    Ordinarily, such a display of vulnerability wouldn’t have even crossed her
    mind, but not with Alecto around. “It would require an inhuman amount of
endurance. Which I have. But also, it’s significantly more taxing to climb    <b>down</b> than it is <b>up,</b> and it would take too much <i>time.</i>
    Scaling into Terra Insanire <i>alone</i> just once took me but three nights
    and four days. I <i>must</i> find the Rhinestone before the new moon, or
    the faunus in red will prevail. Remnant depends on it.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“I’m not sure I follow.” Alecto admitted. “There’s only <b>one</b>    <i>‘faunus in red’</i> that I know of, and he’s from Kingdom Lore. But as
    far as I can tell, we’ve already encountered him.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “You have!?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well, yeah. He calls himself <i>Nomad.</i> He’s got Idol’s Cloak, and
    horns. Rather, antlers. And he wears bandages. That sounds a lot of like
    Kyradin Bael to me. Although, he <i>did</i> drop the crimson motif. But
    even if it’s not him, what could he be doing that’s so bad? He’s all over
    Kingdom Lore for a reason. A <i>good</i> reason.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I… I cannot say. I’m sorry, Lady Alecto. Not even a Keraseer is to know.
    If you were older, perhaps I’d consider it. But the state of affairs is
    about to plunge into chaos, and when the world comes crumbling in around
    me, I must be alone. Forget I said anything.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto joined her on the splintery substitute for a bench. “If you insist.
    I won’t pester you about it, and in return, I get to keep Tormentyst for a
    week.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How about we trade? I get the Keraseer Heirloom.” Eleanor laughed, hitting
    Alecto in the arm for show.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No way! It’s an heirloom for a reason!” Giggles were shared for a few
    fleeting seconds. “Hey, Lady Eleanor?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yes?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Thank you for returning. I didn’t even know you were still alive. It’s
    been difficult ever since, <i>you know…”</i> She wrapped both her arms
    around Eleanor. “On top of that, I’ve had a <i>really</i> bad last couple
    days. I really needed a pick-me-up.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh. Don’t mention it. You have any idea how long it’s been since I had a
    chance to laugh alongside my sisters? This is a gift. It wouldn’t be
    possible without you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Together they waited, trying to spot the tiny vibrations of the moon, the
    twinkle of every star cluster catching their attention for but a moment.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So, I guess we should get started on killing that Delphic, huh? Do you
    have any plan?” Eleanor said. When paired together, the two’s immense
    hatred of Grimm shot down any chance of ending the conflict between
    Beacon’s teams.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No. But that reminds me of something. Besides Beleth, there was another
    Delphic in Forever Fall by the name of Nobody. I tried to kill him, my
    whole team did. He… He ran away! The wimp left before we could finish him
    off. But we’ll get him next time! He used a sword.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t go near him.” Eleanor quickly interrupted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What? Why?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If he uses a sword, then he is a warrior from my past. Listen. Even as a
    Delphic, respect that he is more powerful than you, and he <i>is.</i> He
    won’t hesitate to slay a Keraseer. Leave him to me.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “But he did hesitate. That’s what’s so infuriating-”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A grinning intruder with robes joined the conversation uninvited. “Can it
    truly be? Or have I finally gone wacky? Eleanor? You’re trapped here with
    me too, at long last?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You know her?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Troy!?” Eleanor backed away. “How? I thought you were dead!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He stretched, snickering. “Well, truth be told, I thought so as well.
    Things had gotten a tad hectic with that Wraith, but we made it. That’s
    what counts. What about the rest of Clotho’s Coven. About time they sent in
    the cleanup crew. I know it’s only been a week or so, but I miss ‘em
    already.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “A week? What are you talking about? I lost you a long time ago!” She ran
    up and clenched his shoulders.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t be ridiculous! I know it felt like awhile, but I was banished here
    some five days ago! Or six. Too long in my book. About time they sent in
    the cleanup crew. I know it’s only been a week or so.” He repeated himself
    <i>
        again.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He does that a lot.” Alecto eased Eleanor’s confusion.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re wrong, Troy. It’s been <i>eons</i> since we lost to the Wraith.
    <i>
        You’ve been stuck here for hundreds of years.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Troy’s smile dropped. It seemed as though for once he was gearing up to see
his situation for what it was. But nothing could break through. “Hahaha<i>ha! </i>You always did know how to pull my leg! What a joker! You ought
to teach <i>Mania</i> those tricks, get her to ease up a little bit.    <i>‘Hundreds of years!’ </i>Genius!” He galloped away, cheerily filling
    Terra Insanire with inane laughter.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto crossed her arms. “You knew him hundreds of years ago? How? Guy’s
    nuts, not the sort I’d expect to extrapolate immortality. I never saw him
    in any lore books.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He isn’t immortal. He <i>should</i> be dead… How is it that he’s managed
    to stay so young? Something’s snapped inside him ever since our final
    battle together, that much I can be certain of. But nothing else changed.
    He looks the same.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’d like some answers, too. Troy can teleport, along with his dumb little
    tent of goods. You would know more than me. What is the <i>Wraith,</i> and
    did it beat him? Does it have anything to do with you?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Eleanor balanced her helm on one of her hands, then walked away. “I-I’d
    rather not talk about it. This much I promise, there’s basically nothing
    you know that I don’t concerning <i>him.</i> His survival must have
    something to do with this place” She regretfully said.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Once we kill Beleth and make it out of here, we can study it! Boreas
    probably has a bookshelf full of information on Terra Insanire!” She cupped
    her hands to make sure her words were carried far. Then, awkwardly, she
    looked around and chased after Eleanor.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Now that they’d left the scene, things became <i>quiet.</i> Boreas and Lexy
    had retreated underground. Alecto and Eleanor had begun plotting the
    downfall of the recently discovered Delphic in their ranks. The last
    faction of pacifists trying their best to quell the conflict couldn’t make
    nearly as much ground, considering the startling trend of invading
    <i>
        Purifiers.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What is <i>he</i> doing here!?” Nadia hissed. She, Zara, and Rade were all
    hiding under a blanket of leaves crafted from the Meridian. Ahead, three
    Servants of Servus Portum stomped in sync, creating a cacophony of chrome
    clicks.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Rade squinted. “Looks like a trio of red-eyed peasants to me. Just look at
    those strides, they are proud of who they are!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Shh! Those are the clones of <i>Aamon!</i> They’re from Servus Portum!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Portum!”</i>
    He slammed his fist down, almost giving away their position. He then ranted
    while transcribing the name of the mimics in the Fear Index. “That’s that
    horrible city threatening to engulf Mellow Crest, isn’t it? They’ve caused
    the Baroness enough trouble as is! Let me at him!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nadia stopped him from charging in. “Wait! How do you know about that?
    You’ve never been to Mellow Crest or Servus Portum.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’ve had my fair share of trips there in the past. Crest, I mean. I like
    to keep track of their affairs. It’s sort of a <i>personal</i> matter, you
    see.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Rade, use unconventional attacks! You can destroy them really easily, but
    they learn from their encounters. Try to leave one of them alive! We can
    interrogate him!” Zara piped up.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nadia seized up at the barbarity of Rade’s assassinations, somewhat
    impressed with his ability to sulk in the gloom unseen. “Why? What makes
    you think he’ll talk?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “When I was in Servus Portum, one of those clones tried to negotiate with
    me. He claimed he was on our side.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “And you believed him?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We’re about to find out if he was fibbing.” Zara was satisfied at seeing
    Rade deal with the Purifiers without the use of his trademark choreography
    or pitchfork. Two of them were disabled by smashing their heads together
    from behind. The last was spared as she requested, but Rade couldn’t help
    twisting both metal arms off like an action figure. A knee to the head made
    sure Aamon’s goon was alive, but unable to fight. “Good work!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, many thanks! Would’ve loved to use my semblance. These dupes deserve
    it for giving Mellow Crest such grief. But alas, they haven’t pushed my
    buttons to that point.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Aren’t these cyborgs, though? And what even is your semblance?” Nadia
    didn’t switch off her own ability until she was done speaking.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You don’t want to know.” Zara answered.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How about we strike a deal? Tell me your fears, and I won’t use them
    against you! You can either take your enigma to the grave, or we can die in
    equilibrium! Which one scares you most?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Lucifer told me not to tell you. Bring it up with him.” She passed the
    blame.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He spat in disgust. “A shame! If he knew my semblance, he’d know how
    important it was to be prepared ahead of time! Then again, if I ever used
    it against him, I better be ready for war. Better not count my chickens
    before they hatch. And I have experience in that regard. You’ve heard of
    egging houses, I presume?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Does this story have a point?” Zara herded them towards the still
    conscious Aamon.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Sure, you could learn something. I don’t think throwing eggs at homes is
    that funny, though. No, instead, you <b>freeze</b> the egg. Aim for the
    windows! Then, an hour later, once the egg thaws, the landowner will have a
    real tongue twister lickin’ their brain! Broken window, a dent in the wall,
    and an egg nearby! They’ll be so confused!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So <i>you’re</i> the one who broke our window!” Nadia gasped. “Lucifer’s
    gonna <i>kill</i> you when he finds out about this!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Put that on hold. We have work to do.” Zara pulled Aamon onto his knees.
    She was pleased to see, his eyes were still glowing. “What should we ask
    him?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What’s he doing in Terra Insanire?” Nadia suggested.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What are you doing in Terra-”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We are here to purify these lands, for the glory of Supreme Leader
    Caligula.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What is your plan?” Zara expected him to dodge the question. But he was
    able to regain a small amount of credibility in an honest answer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I was assigned with examining what had caused a recent spike of activity
    in this quadrant, but more specifically I was to gather intelligence on the
following: <i>Lucifer</i> and <i>Selene Virtus</i>,    <i>Alecto Keraseer, Nadia Flora,</i> and
    <i>
        Zara Tir. Additionally, an agent of Caligula named Horace has been
        showing signs of artifice in these mountains.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nadia shook her head. “He can’t be trusted. Why would he release that
    information? Clearly, he intends to lead us astray. Isn’t that right?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Incorrect.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Then why? Why is it that, every time we corner one of you, you squeal so
    easily?” Zara said.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“When <i>Aamom <b>‘AA0001’</b> </i>was constructed by General    <i>Victor,</i> under the supervision of Supreme Leader <i>Caligula,</i> he
    was denied the ability to lie. Aamon only speaks the truth, he knows no
    lies. And therefore, the same applies to us Purifiers.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So, none of you can lie? Why does Caligula hunt us?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I… cannot anticipate.” Over the course of the statement, Aamon’s voice
    drooped until his eyes were extinguished of their avid glow.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Wait! How did you get here?    <i>How did you make it into Terra Insanire?”</i> She shouted. He was
already dead. “Damn! He could’ve known our way out of here. Stupid piece of    <i>junk!”</i> She stomped its head repeatedly, tiring herself out.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Ugh. This is getting old. I’m sick of all this yelling, and    <i>fighting.”</i> Nadia wrapped her hood around her body, shivering. “We’re
    going to miss the dance at this rate. I wish it could just end. I want to
    go <i>home.</i> To Beacon. I miss our beds. I miss all the playing and
    joking with Team Lance. I miss <i>Ella.”</i>

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Don’t give up. I’ve never seen you cry, and I better not now. If you
        lose hope, Nadia, that’s immediate spell-defeat for everyone here. Even
        now, your smile is what motivates us.”
    </i>
    Boreas made everyone but Rade jolt back with his surprise introduction. His
    large hand locked the recently questioned Aamon’s head into a vice grip. He
    dragged it up, and began preaching to it. “What do you think, machine?
    Nothing but an empty husk, now.” He chucked it facedown into a puddle.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Boreas!” Zara blinked to make sure she was seeing right. “Y-You guys can
    see that, right? I’m not going crazy?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “This real enough for you?” He had hauled the rocket-propelled locker all
    the way here, and caused tremors in the earth when he slammed it down.
    “Long story. I’m here to help. Where’s Selene? With this locker, one of us
    has a one way ticket out of here, and I’d say she’s the prime candidate.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nadia dismissed her own desires to escape this nightmare, looking out for
    the wellbeing of someone not only blessed to travel Terra Insanire, but
blessed with the pursuit of a bloodthirsty knight. “No! We should send    <i>Beleth!</i> If either he or Alecto leave, that’ll solve half our
    problems. Alecto will never go for it. If anything, she’d like to prolong
    our entrapment to stay in the ring with him.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I vote that <b>Merlin</b> leaves!” Rade somersaulted over. “Poor thing
    must be terrified! To first be cursed to live the life of an animal, then
    be enslaved by a princess! The
    <i>
        humanity!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b>“No!</b>
    <i>I’m</i>
    leaving.” Zara shut down all dissent. “There is a task I must complete back
    in the kingdoms. This is my chance to set things right.” She focused on the
    three corpses of Aamon.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“You?</i>
    What could you need to do that triumphs our safety?” Nadia whined.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t be mistaken. I will try my hardest to find answers. Boreas, you were
    smart to come in person and allow one of us to leave. Your efforts are best
    spent here, with the Rhinestone’s location. But trust me, Nadia. I need to
    do this.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “O-Okay. I trust you.”
