<p><b><div align="middle">Frequently Asked Questions</div></b></p>
<p>These questions pertain to the Founder Archives. For information regarding RWBY by Rooster Teeth, proceed to the official RWBY Wiki.</p>
<p><b>What is the “Founder Archives”?</b></p>
<p>The Founder Archives is fanfiction for RWBY, a show created by Monty Oum for the network Rooster Teeth. This fanfiction does not utilize a majority of the canon cast, instead using original characters made up for the world of Remnant from RWBY. This fanfic is non-profit, non-canon, and is not officially connected with Rooster Teeth in any way.</p>
<p><b>How do I get started?</b></p>
<p>There are no prologues or specific lore to the Founder Archives required to start reading. If you’re new, and a fan of RWBY, you already know all you need to. Start at the beginning with Chapter 1.</p>
<p><b>Why are the chapters titled “Entries”?</b></p>
<p>An Entry (Ex: Entry 1, Entry 2) is a euphemism for a Chapter. In the lore of the Founder Archives, every chapter is an entry written by someone in-universe, hence the name “Founder Archives”.</p>
<p><b>What are Volumes?</b></p>
<p>Volumes are the method in which chapters are sorted. There are always ten chapters in a single Volume, which tell their own story isolated from other Volumes. Volumes are read in sequential order, starting from the beginning with Volume 1, Chapter 1.</p> 
<p><b>Can the Founder Archives be read anywhere else?</b></p>
<p>The Founder Archives can also be read on Fanfiction.net or on Archive of our Own.</p>
<p><b>Where does the Founder Archives begin in the timeline of RWBY?</b></p> 
<p>It begins right at the start of RWBY’s canon Volume 1, Episode 5: The First Step, Part 2. So essentially, it begins at the moment after Headmaster Ozpin launched Beacon Academy’s new initiates into the Emerald Forest.</p>
<p><b>Where do I go to start watching RWBY?</b></p>
<p>The first five seasons of RWBY are available on the official Rooster Teeth YouTube channel. There are four Trailers that act as prologues. Here’s a YouTube playlist that includes every episode, character short, and trailer up to Volume 6, in order. Currently, there are 7 Volumes of RWBY. Volume 6 onward cannot be found on YouTube, but on the official Rooster Teeth website.</p>
<p><b>What color does Team Lance represent?</b></p>
<p>The short answer is red. Lance was derived from Lancelot, one of the Knights of the Round Table in Arthurian legend. The members of Team Lance are also titled “The Black Knights,” which acts as a parallel of sorts. Therefore, Team Lance is associated with the colors of the Arthurian flag: red, white and gold- but especially red, due to the red dragon of the Round Table.</p>
<p><b>What color does Team Blazer represent?</b></p>
<p>The short answer is red. Blazer was derived from the word “Blaze,” such as a blazing fire. Not only is half the team associated with fire, using flames as their weapons, but their Team Leader wears formal performance attire, such as a dress blazer.</p>
<p><b>What color does Team Burnt represent?</b></p>
<p>The short answer is black. Burnt was chosen as once something is burnt, it become black. Not only did the word fit the names of the members, but the color black sets the stage for most of their costumes and the tone of the team as a whole.</p>
<b><div align="middle">Credits</div></b>
<p>Special thanks to Monty Oum, former lead animator and former creative director of RWBY.</p>
<p>Huge thanks to Rooster Teeth and the entire cast of RWBY, their composer Jeff Williams, their vocalist Casey Williams, the series’ head writers head Miles Luna and Kerry Shawcross, and everyone else who contributed to RWBY.</p>
<p>Without Monty Oum, Rooster Teeth, or any of the amazing people who’ve helped turn RWBY into what it is, the Founder Archives would not exist.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Mathew Gell, who provided his voice for Founder Archives characters in the past.</p>
<p>The Founder Archives were written independently by a fan of RWBY under the pseudonym “Great Lord Fazzie”.  All Official Founder Archives art or art used on the Official Website is original and drawn by Great Lord Fazzie.</p>
<p>The Founder Archives, nor its creator, do not hold any dominion over RWBY, Rooster Teeth, or anything associated with them. All rights rest with the original holders. This project is non-profit, non-canon, and completely fan-made.</p>
