</p>
<p>
    “Ha! As if I could lose to a Grimm! Shut it, Beleth! Actions speak louder
    than words!” Lexy dragged her fist across the center table, swiping the
    alarm clock and plant onto the floor to make way for an arm wrestling
    match.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Right you are, but music speaks louder than either! Hit me with your best
    shot, I dare you!” He laughed, entertaining the contest. They held hands
    and pulled, each holding the other behind their back. Gritting their teeth
    and leaning in with carnivorous grins, Beleth and Lexy were a far cry from
    the peaceful morning and chirping from outside the dorm rooms.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    After many seconds, the table gave out as the culmination of their rivalry.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Ouch.</i>
    We really need a better table for this. Guess I’m paying for that one,
    considering I <i>won.”</i> He boasted. He was already bracing himself
    against a speeding pillow from Lexy’s bed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How did <i>you</i> win? You let go first!” Lexy stomped her feet.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “When my hand leaves <i>your</i> hand, we <i>both</i> let go. How could
    either of us <i>‘let go first?’</i> Or no, you wanted me to continue the
    game without a <i>table</i>.” Beleth made a movement with his hand to
    suggest Lexy was crazy.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Maybe we should ditch the whole arm-wrestling thing.” She said.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Excuses to give up.” He rolled his eyes.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re in denial.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I deny that fact!” He argued.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Keep it up, and I’ll whack you upside the head with that violin.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You wouldn’t dare touch my violin! You love the sound too much.” Beleth
    balanced the instrument on his shoulder, gesturing as his bow was missing.
    Another fluffy projectile was launched. “If you wanted a pillow fight, you
    could ask.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Imagine <i>team</i> pillow fights. Who would you want on your side, Zara
    or Rade?” She sat down.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I think the last thing either of us needs is a wild card. Rade’s quick,
    sure, but his jerky movements just make me really uncomfortable.” He
    giggled. “Can you imagine living like that? He looks like a robot half the
    time.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Does that make him human the other half? What like a <i>cyborg?</i> Don’t
    be ridiculous.” Lexy shook her head at the idea, opening up the window to
    wake their top choice. “Zara, get up! It’s almost time for class!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Mhmm. Wh-what time is it?” She mumbled, one of her arms hanging off the
    bed towards the vacant scenery.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s about five to nine.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“What?</i>
    Move!” She sprung out of bed through the cabin.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Where’s the fire?” Beleth blocked the exit.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Here!” Zara held up a flaming hook to his face, scaring him out of the
    way. “Class is like a minute away! You guys wanna be late again, stay here!
    Be my guest. But if you’re smart, you’ll come with me! And that includes
    Rade. Where is he, anyway?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Probably at class.” Beleth shrugged, following her eyes to a vacant
    sleeping bag strapped to the ceiling fan.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Then get going!” She bolted through the door. Her two teammates laughed
    after her. Down the elevator, through the halls, and out the building
    brought them halfway there. And they only lost <i>two</i> minutes. It
    seemed all their concern was superfluous, as another two had them stationed
    in a class that had no signs of starting anytime soon.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Finally reading up on those textbooks, huh?” Beleth nudged Rade in the
    shoulder.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Only the most important one, the <i>Fear Index!</i> And that reminds me,
    Beleth. Most people fear Grimm, but I think you might be exempt from that
    study! I mean, you may not have been, but it’s just a hunch of mine. So the
    question must be asked, what <i>do</i> you fear?” Even though Rade had
    accumulated a wealth of knowledge on this subject, all solidified in his
    book, some peers slipped through the cracks. Such was the case with his own
    team.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You should really find better mind games than just rambling and hoping we
    let our guard down.” Beleth took a seat with the rest of Team Blazer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“I save <i>those</i> ploys for when it truly matters! Trust me, if I    <i>really</i> needed your fears, it’d already be done. Same goes for our
    pals over on Lance!” He admitted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Give me a break. Don’t forget, you were more than willing to <i>fight</i>
    Lucifer over the issue, and you’re telling me you could have found out what
    he was scared of right then and there if you wanted to?” Zara beamed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Please. Little more than friendly competition, data on his fighting stance
    more so than his nightmares, plus since that time I’ve deduced his secrets!
    As though I need anybody to <i>tell</i> me.” Rade’s rant was merely
    friendly banter, as his voice indicated.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Okay, what is it then?” Lexy interjected.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The best magicians never give away their tricks!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “C’mon, this is Team Blazer, baby! That’s <i>Beleth, Lexy, Zara,</i> and
    you- <i>Rade!</i> Your secret’s safe with us!” Their team leader announced.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Frankly I think I’d rather lick a cactus than trust you with a secret.”
    Lexy, despite her threat, hit <i>him</i> in the arm.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’d mess up your makeup just for me?” He teased, prepping a lunge as he
    was certain she’d aggress. He was right. He almost tripped over both Zara
    and Rade just to graze by Lexy’s wrath. Both zoomed into their seats once a
    clue of Stam’s return came forth, and it was only then that they noticed
    somebody sitting next to him, sleeping.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Class is now in session! Welcome everyone, thank you for arriving on time!
    As you’re all aware, we’ve started late as I figured today, to celebrate
    the arrival of our new faculty, we’d have a bit of fun. Allow me to
introduce to you the newest staff member of Beacon Academy:    <i>Professor Audrey Penelope!”</i> Stam gave her a firm pat on the back,
    snapping her out of her slumber. It was clear she was snoozing away up
    until that point, leaning her head on her arm. The promise of a Huntress
    alone brought forth applause.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s an honor to meet you all. I look forward to getting to know each of
    you one by one.” Penelope didn’t have the energy to yell nor get up, even
    after some sips of coffee.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You see, Miss Penelope, or rather <i>Professor Penelope,</i> is a new
    teacher here at Beacon. Noting how she’s the slightest bit inexperienced,
and there’s no open classrooms at this time, she’ll be accompanying    <i>us</i> until we can get her better situated. Right!” Stam set his hand
    on her shoulder again, seizing her from her dreams a second time.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Th-that’s right! You guys are in the middle of the defensive unit, if I’m
    not mistaken.” She finally stood up, nodding when the class confirmed her
    hunches. “Perfect. Surely by now, each of you understand the value of… how
    do I say this? <i>Not getting hit?</i> Point is, we’re putting a twist on
    the typical exercise by partaking in
    <i>
        team duels.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The classroom’s inhabitants rumbled, excited at the idea. Professor Stam
    took over for a longwinded explanation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The way this works is, team leaders will fight each other. First person to
    take damage loses, no surprise there! Once a victor is determined, they
    will fight the next member of the beaten team! First team to lose all its
    members will lose, simply put. First teams to fight: Lance and Blazer!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Got it. So If I lose, Alecto will fight the leader I failed to beat.
        If she wins, she fights the next in Team Blazer. But then, if we
        somehow lose three times, <b>Selene</b> will have to fight.”
    </i>
Lucifer gave himself a silent briefing. “And that’s not an option    <i>yet.”</i> The team chiefs joined each other on the stage where Penelope
    was waiting
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What’s your name?” She shook the soldier’s hand, then the violinist’s.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Lucifer.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Beleth, great to meet you!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You too. Now, Stam, do I just tell them to fight?” She inquired.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yes! They’ll do the rest.” With Penelope’s signal, the fireworks began.
    Without any clue of Beleth’s attitude in combat nor in general despite
    knowing Rade and Zara, Lucifer was in for a shock. Anybody in this position
    would be perplexed to see him raise a violin to begin the fight. He was
    scarily effective at unnerving a target with the supposed battle stance.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer paused before running in to end the fight with hopefully a simple
    strike. Beleth planned everything, capitalizing on the unfamiliarity with a
    standard but unorthodox method of fighting. He raked his bow across the
    strings, using his <i>semblance</i> to <i>transmute</i> music into energy.
    A powerful rift was ripped into reality out of thin air, blasting Lucifer
    onto his back.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “W-What!? <i>Argh!”</i> He slammed his clenched hand onto the ground. Had
    this been a normal fight, that one ruse alone wouldn’t have been enough to
    defeat Lucifer, but it wouldn’t work a second time. Alecto had watched like
    a hawk, and her competitive spirit mixed with a lust for victory would make
    her hard to hit. At least, that was the idea.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    On Penelope’s mark, Alecto flipped around the musical onslaught to meet
    Beleth head on. Soon, the admittedly luxurious sound of his violin had
    vanished along with the possibility of long ranged combat, but he still had
    the bow. Long, sturdy, and with a bladed edge made for this sort of bout,
    he decided to show off impressive swordplay. But Alecto still had him beat.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
His parries were good at blocking her sword, but he became too eager with    <i>just</i> that strategy. Alecto finally saw him overextend, and sent him
    into the air with a cape whip. Surely the fall would take a bit of his
    Aura, she rationalized, pausing for a breather. She had completely
    overlooked the advantages of a projectile-based weapon.
    <p>

    Prior to hitting the floor, Beleth played a simple stroke and blindsided
    Alecto. They’d lost the smallest bit of Aura within one second of each
    other, but that tiny window was enough to determine that Beleth won.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Fine. You win.” Alecto crawled up and shook his hand. “That was clever,
    I’ll admit, but you won’t get lucky next time.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“No!</i>
    Nadia! I need a favor!” Lucifer turned to his last gambit, panicked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Of course. What is it?” She flexed her needles, preparing herself.
    Although, it was clear she held a crippling lack of grace under pressure.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Selene can’t go up there, her Semblance isn’t developed enough yet! She
    won’t stand a chance. I need you to beat Team Blazer and spare her a
    hopeless fight.” He spoke with tamed respect, but not enough to prevent
    Selene’s knowledge of his request.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s alright, really. I can at least <i>try</i> dodging.” The princess
    didn’t want to burden anyone, but her worries were audible through her
    shivering voice.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No. <i>It’s going to be alright.</i> I’ll try taking them on. It can’t be
    that hard to get one hit off for a nimble assassin like me, wouldn’t you
    say? I mean, just look. How does he even see with that blindfold on all the
    time?” Nadia gave a classic smile and headed to the arena.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Thank you.” Lucifer couldn’t let her favor go unpaid, as long as she
    succeeded.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-It’s the least I could do.” Nadia passed Alecto to fight this mysterious
    lyrical musician. Considering the tattered fabric covering his face, it
    should be even easier to sneak up on him than usual. Penelope- after
    getting their names, declared the fight underway, and Nadia dissipated from
    existence before Beleth could even get situated.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What the!?” He lowered his violin in pure bewilderment. Much like the
    strategy he used on Lucifer, the unknown semblance ended duels in seconds.
    Nadia was already behind him, and had jammed one of her toxins into his
    back. “Ouch!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nadia wins!” Stam couldn’t help but laugh. Whenever the fight wasn’t a
    tremendous joust eating up an extensive amount of time, it was over in less
    than five seconds. “That victory was well earned, Miss Flora! But perhaps
    there are other fields on which we can explore. I noticed you’re still
    sitting in the very back of my classroom, even one row away from your team.
    How about a seat right here, in the front? Surely this will help shatter
    your shell!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “U-Um, well… Actually, I…”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Haha! Something to consider moving forward.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    After two victories, Beleth likely couldn’t have given much more anyway.
    Lexy, by contrast, was brimming with energy, just waiting to embolden their
    lead and show everyone up. Not to mention, she’d just seen the winning tactic
    twice.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Name’s Lexy.” She held a peace sign forward.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh. N-Nadia. I… I like your outfit.” Nadia wasn’t lying. Indeed the two
    were nearly opposite in appearance, they were each great in their own
    right.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You too! I don’t usually like blue, but it looks great on you-“
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Enough chit-chat! Fight!” Another announcement from Stam of the battle’s
    beginning, and they were off. Nadia learned from Lucifer’s mistakes,
studying Lexy rather than charging in. The Flame Bearer fought with a    <i>wheel,</i> a mechanical apparatus enveloped in fire. Twirling it around
    from a chain was a neat distraction, not that it gave much data.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Without warning, the contraption was swung around, creating a real problem
    as the lingering inferno made the danger zone much bigger than it seemed.
    Avoiding the wheel altogether was the best option. Using her semblance only
    to keep Lexy guessing rather than a crutch kept her in the challenge up
    until she was within stabbing distance.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Haha! Gotcha!” Lexy somersaulted away with ease. Nadia quickly deduced
    that breaking distance wasn’t realistic as long as Lexy persisted such
    mobility. If only there was some way to anchor her down.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nadia figured it out. Turning invisible and grabbing the chain holding the
    hot gear caused it to swivel around, back into its owner. Lexy, as long as
    her chain was being held, could not escape. Losing more Aura than anyone
    with a single clash, she was bested disregarding the fact she had plenty
    more to give.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oof! Good fight! I can’t wait for a <i>real</i> one sometime.” Lexy
    slipped to her feet.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “...” Nadia sent her back with silence.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Man! She’s good.” Lexy huffed in her seat, knowing she was just giving
    Beleth more material.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Too good. If only you had some sort of music-oriented semblance to-” He
    started, but couldn’t finish. Lexy tackled him to the ground out of view
    under the desk. Zara had to leave for her turn, hoping to draw the
    attention off them.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Go get ‘em! But don’t get ‘em too hard, I want a shot at this too!” Rade
    slapped his desk over and over to emphasize his encouragement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Finally, a familiar face.” Nadia gasped. The last two rounds had done a
    number on her. Winning another two seemed like an impossibility.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah, no kidding. Have you ever met Beleth or Lexy?” Zara looked back at
    the unusual combatants. She received a nod back and forth.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Great work everyone! We’re all squared up now, two of you remain on either
    team! As in the field, there are times you’ll have not a moment to recover!
    Fight!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If it was an option, Nadia would throw the towel in. A glance at Lucifer
    reminded her why she was doing this rather than passing the torch onto
    Selene. “I-I can’t let him down!” An inaudible whisper set the stage.
    <i>
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Zara danced around with her heated hooks whirling in all directions,
    requiring strenuous evasion techniques. But this engagement would not last
    as long as the others. Nadia’s insistence on some sort of loophole proved
    to be her downfall. She grabbed ahold of both the hooks then tried pulling
    Zara in- a modification of her approach with Lexy.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Wow. Your students are something else.” Penelope analyzed every match
    along with Stam. “When I was in Beacon, fighting ability was all that
anyone cared about. It was all so… <i>Brutish</i>. I like how    <i>cunning</i> the fighters are these days.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, indeed. It’s these sorts of alternate scenarios that force my
    students to think on their feet. Wit alone can take you far, but only if
    paired with their strengths. It’s the hands off approach that worked for
    me, and it’ll work for them. I guarantee it.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s probably why I was so sleepy in class. My teachers gave me writing
    assignments and called it a day. I’m afraid semblance training was the only
    experience <i>I</i> had. Besides, of course…” Several yawns accompanied
    elaboration.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What do you think of this gambit here? Miss Haken seems to be in great
    trouble.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Zara has this one under control. Her confidence tells me she must have
    something up her sleeve, much like those hooks. Pulling her in while
    disabling her weapons is foolproof, but only to
    <i>
        fools.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Very good, Professor Penelope. I’m impressed.” Stam watched the prediction
    come true.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nadia’s knowledge of Zara only ran so deep, and in the chaos she overlooked
    a pivotal ability possessed by the faunus. The hooks in her hands were set
    aflame even at a great distance from their master, and nothing could be
    done to prevent the burning. She lost.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No!” Nadia fell to her knees, confirming her failure by looking up at the
    live scoreboard.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Good work, Miss Haken. Miss Virtus, step up to the plate! I say it’s about
    time we saw something from you!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“What did you do?!”</i> Lucifer berated his teammate upon her return, struggling to maintain an
    indoor voice.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I tried, I swear! It was too much for me. I-I’m sorry.” She couldn’t face
    him head on.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s not a big deal, guys!” Selene tried her best to diffuse the
    situation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You had to do <i>one</i> thing!” He wasn’t having it.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“I had to do <i>four</i> things! Neither you, nor <i>you</i> could beat    <b>one</b> opponent!” She pointed first at her aggressor, then Alecto.
    <i>
        “I’m sorry! How many times do I have to say it?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ahem!” Stam had somehow marched to their table without making a sound.
    “There seems to be some sort of issue here. Very well. Just this once, I’ll
    let Miss Virtus opt out. In her place, Mister… err, <i>Merlin</i> can
    fight. I’d like to see what he can do up close, anyway. Do not expect this
    a second time, Miss Virtus.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Praise be. You have my gratitude, Professor.” Lucifer couldn’t help an
    exhale of relief. Nadia laid her head in her arms, concealing her face.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “But that quarrel will have to wait! Class should be just about over now.
    Time flew quickly! Have a great rest of your day everyone, and remember,
    I’m always right here if you need me!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Team Lance left in unison, waiting until they were outside to continue
    their debate. Walking at a brisk pace, they made it to the entrance of
    their dorm room before Nadia felt her instinctive guilt eating away at her.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Lucifer. I’m sorry, I really tried to win all those fights for you! I
    promise.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Every time I say anything to you, I’m met with an apology. It’s getting
    old. To have a semblance like yours, and still fail? You could have done
    the <i>‘cloak-and-dagger’</i> every single time without error! It’s all I
    ask.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s not how it works! All you’ve ever done is make demands of me! Like
    with Selene and her semblance! I’d have helped whenever possible, I just
    couldn’t at <i>that</i> moment! What’s so hard to understand about that?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Guys, we should really do this somewhere else.” Selene failed to reach her
    pals.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, yes! Too busy enjoying yourself at <i>Augustus Correctional,</i>
    leaving us in the dirt!” Lucifer shouted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“That’s not true! Ella needed my help, she needs to figure out who she    <i>is!”</i> Nadia was tired of his constant intrusions.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Ella</i>
    this, <i>Ella</i> that! It’s all I ever hear from you! <i>Enough!</i> The
    only thing worse is your non-stop defense of those freaks in the White
    Fang! What’s so important about <i>either</i> of them?!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Lucifer, let it go! We can talk about this later.” Alecto slipped
    in-between them. He shoved her out of the way.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
“You’ve tested my patience for the last time! I am your        <b>Team Leader,</b> and you <b>will</b> follow my command! The White
        Fang is a band of feral beasts, heartless! As is <b>anyone</b> who
        sympathizes with them!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How dare you!” Nadia swung her fist forward, aiming for his chest. He was
    too fast, snatching her hand out of the air and throwing his teammate to
    the ground with one pull. She looked him in the eyes, heartbroken.
    <i>
        “…I’m not going to cry. Not for you.”
        <p>

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Like always. Go run off with your <b>real</b> friends at Augustus
        Correctional Facility.”
    </i>
    His words had an eerily cold ring to it. She looked him in the eyes, with
    tears in her own.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “I-I hate you! I’m leaving to Mistral! You’re never going to see me
        again!”
    </i>
    Nadia scrambling to her feet.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nadia, wait! Stop!” Selene reached forward. It was impossible for her to
    gain any ground in a race of these proportions, and she knew it.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Lucifer!”</i>
    Alecto seethed. She didn’t have time to reprimand him if she wanted to
    catch up. Nadia navigated her way to the gates of Beacon Academy without
    looking back. It wasn’t until she stopped at the main avenue to control her
    breathing that rattling armor gave away Alecto’s presence, doing the job
    long before her words did.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Wait, Nadia! You <i>can’t</i> go! You’re coming back, <i>right!?”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Never.”

</p>
<p>
“Don’t do this! I’ll make Lucifer apologize, we can go meet Ella    <i>together!</i>

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We can still fix this. Your friends need you!” Alecto begged.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“You heard him. I don’t have any friends.”</i>
    Nadia sprinted away once again.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Don’t say that! I… I’m one of them…”</i>
    She whispered that last part to herself, comprehending the unwavering
    determination of Nadia. Alecto had no choice but to watch her hooded
    ex-teammate leave Beacon Academy, and Team Lance altogether.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Seeing as how she’d made the trip to and from Vale’s prison so many times,
    she could make it there faster than anyone else save for Augustus himself.
    And now taking into account her predicament, this was the fastest she’d
    ever traveled this path. After that, the classic bridge was all that stood
    in her way. It didn’t stop her. She’d become a master of roaming the
    complex’s corridors.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Augustus. It’s me.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Welcome back. What’s wrong?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “N-Nothing. How are you doing?” She questioned, hiding her face behind a
    hood.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…I’ve got bad news. We’ve still found nothing on Ella.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yes?” The Fleeting Ghost herself entered the room at the mention of her
    name. Nadia sighed, having just learned the last thing she wanted to hear.
    With no explanation she was met with a snug hug. “N-Nadia!”
    <p>

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Great to see you, Ella. I needed this right now.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Look, I’ve <i>personally</i> scoured the records. There’s nothing on her,
    in Vale at least. But given her… <i>complexion,</i> I think it would be a
    good idea to send her to <i>Atlas.</i> It’s likely she has some sort of
    connection to the Kingdom. Not to mention, it’d be a joy to abuse their
    database.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Atlas? That can’t be right. How long will she be there?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Can’t say for sure. That’s not the worst of it though. Grimm attacks in
    Forever Fall have reached a fever pitch, and not even the most secluded
    train tracks can escape them altogether.” Augustus summoned a holographic
    map and highlighted the best route. “We need somebody disposable to take
    her. Not only is my first option better off dead, he’s more than capable.
    Neither of you are going to like this, but I’ve already made my mind. Don’t
    worry, I am in
    <i>
        complete control.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “W-Who is it?” Ella felt an impending sense of dread.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He’s locked up in the Crypt right now. Follow me.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No. We’re not doing this.” Nadia already suspected his first choice. Her
    big mistake was entertaining him by doing as he said, following behind.
    About ten dungeon doors later, and all three were locked in a padded cell
    alongside the maniac himself.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Finally decided to drop in, eh? I don’t blame you, I’d want in on this
    hotel room, too!” Dimitri grinned. He was sitting in the chair with both
    feet balanced on the table. A thick chain was preventing his escape,
    attached to his folded arms. “Nadia! Just couldn’t leave it alone, could
    you? You try to run away, yet you get brought back to <i>me.</i> How long
    as it been, <i>my pretty?”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Silence.” Augustus grabbed the bold links to reel him in. “You’re in luck,
    outside beckons. <i>This</i> is Ella.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Greetings, Ella! It’s my pleasure to meet you <i>again!”</i> He leaned
    down, scaring both the teenagers.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Again? Y-You’re talking nonsense. Point is, she’s going to Atlas by train.
    It’s overrun with Grimm, therefore I’ve chosen <b>you</b> to accompany
    her.” Augustus informed the criminal.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Really? You’ve come to <i>me</i> for help? My, oh my! How the tables have
    turned.” Dimitri smirked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What have I been doing this entire time, you <i>fool?</i> Asking
    questions. Of course I’ve come to you for help. Only this time, you’ll
    cooperate. The Administrator orders it.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Who is this <i>‘Administrator’</i> I hear so much about? I mean, if I get
    some fresh air, I guess we’re all on board eh? Any view is better than this
    dump.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No!” Nadia had counted on Dimitri to refuse. “Why can’t Ella just take a
    bullhead? <i>I</i> could accompany her!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Crossing a continent alone is a tall task for such a ship. An ocean on top
    of that doesn’t sound too great, does it? We would need an aircraft carrier
    for a trip like <i>that,</i> and ironically enough those only reside in
    Atlas. No offense, but <i>Mister Gimp</i> here is far better equipped for a
    mission of this caliber than you. Besides, you’re needed in Vale, aren’t
    you?” Augustus explained.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Not anymore.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Mister <i>Gimp?</i> At least I’ve got two legs, sonny!” Dimitri didn’t go
    any further with the insults, now confused that his cuffs were unlatched
    and he hadn’t yet been tortured. “How kind of you to trust so innocent a
    soul as me, can’t say I would do the same!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Right you are.” Augustus slapped a tracking device around his wrist on the
    way to the exit. “With this, I’ll have your exact location at <b>all</b>
    times. If you go dark on me, I <i>will</i> find you, and we’ll <i>both</i>
    be sorry. I’d talk to you about how any attempts to remove it will result
    in your very timely demise, but you <i>won’t</i> be taking it off. I’ll
    have personnel waiting for you in Atlas. Expect one <i>‘Madam Phoebe.’”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    To make his point, Augustus jerked Dimitri’s arm onto the table and drove
    his sword into the bracelet with considerable strength. Not a
    <i>
        dent.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Indestructible souvenirs! Quite the gimmick.” Dimitri lied. “Guess I’m
    locked in, now. I’ll go with you on your little train ride, on one
    condition. I want my stuff back.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“But of course. How else will you defend Ella? Anything happens to    <i>her,</i> and you will understand <i>retribution.</i> Are we clear?
    Perfect.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No! He’s serious! Don’t you <i>dare</i> hurt her!” Nadia pointed
    accusingly.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well, if that’s <i>your</i> criteria, how could I refuse? I could never
    disappoint you, my pretty! <i>My lovely, young protégé! </i>When I come
    back, we can start changing that sick attitude. I’m looking forward to it!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Augustus unlocked every door and led his three companions to a vault on the
    west end of his penitentiary. “The <i>Evidence Locker.</i> Every little
    piece of scum has their goodies stored here. Pretty much everything in this
    place gathers dust until it falls apart. I’d keep <i>you</i> here to
    achieve the same effect if you weren’t so valuable.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Real flattering, as if I like the situation. Aha, perfect! That’s    <i>so</i> much better!” Dimitri stashed his crowbar in his pants, gathered
    up his watch and two necklaces, then wrapped his camera around his neck.
    Last was the iconic boater hat.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Is that all? Need any other nonsensical trinkets or useless knick-knacks?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well if you’re offering, I bet you wouldn’t part with those shades because
    you know they’d look <i>real</i> hot on me.” Dimitri bowed, signifying his
    contentment with all this time in jail. The train awaited.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Just remember, if my patience is tested in any way, I’ll know our trust is
    shattered, and I’ll have no use to let you live in Remnant. Hopefully the
    Administrator goes easier on you than he will me. That way I’ll have a shot
    at you myself-“
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Tell the Administrator I’m sure he’s looking very <i>cute</i> today.”
    Dimitri slammed the door of the freight cart with Ella behind him. Augustus
    prompted a few bangs on the locomotive to have Dimitri sent out of here as
    fast as possible. It was about time. With that act, Dimitri and Ella left
    Vale. Nadia turned to do the same.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Where are you going?” Augustus asked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m leaving the Kingdom. Returning to Mistral.” She couldn’t look at him
    dead on.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What? After all this time, you’re going to leave me hanging? What about
    Ella, or Beacon Academy? She still hasn’t met those friends of yours you’ve
    talked so much about! Neither have I.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I… Things just didn’t work out. Maybe it’s for the best. I’d only ever
    dragged them down.” She made her way east, to the welcoming arms of Mistral
    whence she came. Nadia had already bid goodbye to one batch of companions
    that day, now she was forced to do the same with another. Augustus had
    nothing worth saying to halt her jog across the bridge other than a soft
    omen.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Farewell.”

    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Dimitri and Ella blitzed through the Forever Fall forest in the wake of a
    dying sun. No Grimm had interrupted yet, fortunately for Ella. Dimitri
    cared not. A little action probably would have done him well after such a
    long time in confinement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ever been to Atlas?” He asked. Ella gulped and shook her head. The
    prospect of spending an afternoon with what she’d been told was a
    borderline psychopath wasn’t very appealing. “Well when this caboose lands,
    I’ll show you around. It’s a bit cold, but you won’t need any bug-spray. If
we can score a villa in the mountains, the worst I’ll bet on is a    <i>creep.</i> Mere fodder, I tell you!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Y-You’re a criminal, aren’t you?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ack! They’ve filled your head with lies over at the prison! Don’t be
    ridiculous. I’m just a normal guy, I promise! Do I <i>look</i> like such a
    bad dude?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Kind of.” She had to admit while his voice and visage worked against him,
    Dimitri was <i>somewhat</i> dressed like a normal person. She couldn’t
    really complain though, the way <i>she</i> presented herself.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What can I say, a crime lord’s gotta look the part. Not that I try, mind
    you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I… I don’t think you can show me around in Atlas. They’re going to come
    get you if you don’t return.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, damn.” He tried to rip the machine off his arm to no avail. Banging it
    against the control panel couldn’t work either. Ella gasped, focusing on
    the track. Sitting in the main cart seemed the most sensible thing to do.
    Each segment of the train was compact but thoroughly attached by several
    plated chains. “How in the lord am I supposed to get rid of this thing?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t think you’re supposed to. Ah! W-What was that?” Something landed
    on the last of many wagons, but the shockwaves could still be felt from
    here. As if the overhead screech of a griffon wasn’t enough.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Wait here. This evening, I am your host! And I won’t have any    <i>uninvited guests</i> spoil the mood.” Dimitri sealed off the main engine
    and pranced down every car to witness the intruder. He beheld a haunting
    specimen with a black cloud of anxiety complimenting his very presence. The
    figure was standing at the edge of the speeding monorail, oblivious to
    Dimitri. His coat flapped in the wind whilst the stranger eyed the
    landscape. “Uh. Excuse me? Who are you, pal?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>“I am Nobody.” </i></b>
    The meddler turned to provide a vague answer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Alright, <i>Nobody.</i> State your business.” Dimitri cared not of this
    newcomer’s name, but pegged him as <i>‘Nobody’</i> for identity’s sake.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “These shipments tend to hold dust, not that I care for that, but there’s
    nothing on this one. Of all the trains I’ve tackled, why was <i>this</i>
    one guarded? The humans didn’t send you as an ambassador, did they?” Nobody
    rested his hand on the hilt of his blade, approaching.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Humans? What are you <i>on</i> about? I’m only the ambassador for the
    Great Madman! That’s me, myself, and I:
    <i>

        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “They didn’t. A shame. At least I’ll have the privilege of releasing from
    his life the now unveiled <i>‘Great Madman,’ <b>Dimitri.” </b></i>
    <b>

    </p>

<p>
    <i>“Ohhh,</i>
    I see!” The tourist couldn’t believe he hadn’t realized earlier. It all
made sense to him now. The <i>red eyes</i> and the frilled, leather-like    <i>skin </i>was a dead giveaway. “You’re a <b>Delphic,</b> aren’t you!?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Delphics? What do you think you know about me?” Nobody’s voice, in what
    seemed to be commonplace, simmered with malevolent yet chivalrous energy.
    But this time, there was something curious about it.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well, if you must know, I was sent here by a man named <i>Augustus.</i>
    The freak is a <i>cop.</i> He abuses <i>dark energy</i> from I’m assuming
his semblance. He’s been pounding me for quite some time now, looking for    <i>Delphics.</i> I can only imagine he was talking about you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Me? I’m afraid I must admit then, perhaps I should go see this Augustus
    person. Perhaps… Returning whence you came to find see this
    Delphic-searching man might prove useful.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How so?” Dimitri yawned.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “A mystery for another life. One that must wait in your case,
    unfortunately. If I kill you, the trail runs dry. Therefore should I
succeed to find the ones I’m looking for, I’ll cut them down thinking of    <i>you.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>

    “And whom may I have the pleasure of aiding the death of?”

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Somebody who matters only to me. It’s an honor for you really, to be in my
    thoughts while using this blade.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I get the impression it’s pretty strong then, <i>Grimmy-</i> Am I right?”

<p>
    <i>
        “Yes. Practically all my time goes to tending her steel, pinning her as
        deservedly and undoubtedly the sharpest in <b>all</b> of Remnant.”

    Nobody held up his sheath to the sunlight, proud.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If that’s the case, then we’ll strike a deal. If you use that sword to cut
    this wristband off, I’ll take you straight to Augustus. As long as I get
    front row seats to the show, I’d say that’s pretty even, no?

<p>
    “I wouldn’t waste my beloved on so trivial a matter, but it’s clear you
    hold no reservations.” Nobody tossed the brand to Dimitri, allowing him to
    do the job himself. To his amazement, unsheathing it revealed a fine blade. Even
    more impressive, it cut through the tracking appliance like partially melted butter. The mechanism dipped below, now out of sight.

    Nobody paced up to the ledge keeping him high above the molting trees,
    basking in the horizon’s illuminator.

    Dimitri sat on the brink alongside him, savoring the shaky alliance. Both
    were memorized by the sunset, possibly contemplating all the ways they
    might betray each other at that very moment.

    Although, the <i>‘man’ </i>who both taught and lived by that phrase is
    hardly worth such respect.” Without waiting, Nobody slowly fed his sword
    into its holster.

    The admirable but increasingly loud sound bounced around the Forever Fall
    Forest, and soon after a griffon’s roar joined them. That expert call now
    done, Nobody leapt off the train onto the swooping Grimm, tearing through
    the air until he faded into the clamber of clouds.

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>

    “Fantastic.” Dimitri enjoyed the breeze preceding a return to the front
    chambers. Opening the door startled an already uneasy Ella.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re back! I-I thought something might have happened…”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Simply a false alarm! Just a lost Beowolf stupid enough to wander off the
    beaten path. Something tells me that’s the only Grimm setback we should be
    expecting. Nothing but clear skies and fruitful rest lie ahead!” Dimitri
    leaned back in one of the two seats, crossing his arms, now comfy for the
    remainder of the rumbly ride. But back in Vale, the more virtuous defenders
    had their hands full with semblance training, and damage control in Nadia’s
    wake. It was impossible to tell which one was more arduous.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Selene’s eyes were clenched shut, every muscle in her body tensing, her
    arms directed towards the result of her immense focus. With Alecto’s
    assistance, she was able to produce a cruel worm-hole. Despite the
    struggling, she could do no more.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ugh. It’s too much.” Selene slumped over, unable to maintain the vortex.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t worry. You’re doing great.” Lucifer assured.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I actually think we should find you a weapon. Semblances are great and
    all, but I don’t recommend you rely on them. Using your powers as a crutch
    might work most of the time, but you’ll be a walking target when it
    doesn’t.” Alecto said.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How come?” The dress-toting apprentice inquired.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Semblances don’t work if your Aura is broken. You’re already in trouble if
    things get to that point, but if you have nothing to offer other than a
    power that no longer works, you’re good as dead. Perfect your fighting
    style, and you’ll at least have a <i>chance.”</i> Alecto tried to describe
    the intricacies of semblances as best she could.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It must be great to fight <i>and</i> have an effective semblance! Can you
    show me yours?” Selene tilted her head.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I could try, but I usually save it for the <i>real</i> threats. It’s a
    little intense. But <i>maybe</i> I could try pulling back and… Here, have a
    look.” Alecto switched arms to the normally absent golden broadsword. The
    last time it had been utilized, she was taking down the Grover in the
    depths of the Emerald Forest. So much had changed in that time.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The act of reaching forward with barbed fingers, mixed with extreme focus,
    forced the nearby chair to warp. It was surrounded in a colorless haze,
    which then congregated to form a liquid black sphere. Alecto put her hand
    on her waist, admiring the work.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So what is this exactly? You can turn objects into black holes?” Lucifer
    asked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It locks objects, or people, into <i>darkness</i> for a moment. Think if
    it like a stun, that amplifies damage. This is just a small demonstration.”
    Alecto clarified. To finish the show, she slashed the floating void with
    her sword. No apparent effect, until a couple seconds later the ball
    shattered, and out bounced two halves of a wooden chair.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Woah! That’s so cool!” Selene clapped.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-It was just a small example.” Alecto always shied away from praise.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What is it called?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Are we at that point where we’re <i>naming</i> our semblances? Usually
people just say something generic like <i>‘strength.’</i> I’ve had a few    <i>ideas</i> for a name, as part of that fun little exercise Stam gave us.
    Like, <i>‘Keraseer Justice’</i> or something similar. It’s dumb, I know.
    But enough about me. What’s your semblance called, Lucifer? Come to think
    of it… what is your semblance, <i>period?”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I wouldn’t say it’s a secret, but I’ll wait to reveal it until you’ve seen
    it firsthand. Scratch that, because In fact, you already have. You just
    don’t know it.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Really? Is it the ability to push my buttons?” Alecto mocked him.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I wonder what Nadia’s is called. Maybe we can ask her when she comes
    back.” Selene sighed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “She’ll be fine.” Lucifer turned, a hint of insecurity in his voice.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “She said she’d never be back, Lucifer. Could you at least <i>act</i> a
    little more concerned, please, just to humor us?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I <i>am</i> concerned. I just think she’ll come back. We can discuss
    things when she <i>does.”</i> Lucifer left the combat halls, not in the
    right spirits to talk about it. Selene and Alecto looked at each other as
    the doors closed behind him.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I hope he’s right. Not much we can do, anyway… But we cannot dwell on it.
    Back to semblance training. Again.” Alecto commanded. Selene obeyed,
    raising her arms and concentrating to conjure up another purple pool. Her
    semblance had not yet evolved past this primitive stage, this feat alone
    impressing the overseer. There was far more work left to do, if Selene’s
    recollection of her powers in the past were anything to go off of.
