<p>
The first sign that Lucifer’s ordeal in Terra Insanire was ending, or    <i>escalating,</i> came from the one who started it all. Clouds mounted an
    attack on the skies with Alecto’s uncharacteristically meek admission into
    the underbelly of the Meridian.
    <b>
        <i>
            <p>
            </p>
        </i>
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“It is going to rain tonight. You should stay in this cave. Here, take my    <i>cape</i> in case you get wet.” Lucifer tied the sentimental attire
    around Selene’s shoulders. “Why the long face? It looks good on you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Heehee!</i>
    You’re too kind. Red always fit well on me! Maybe I should upgrade my
    dresses sometime…”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If you so desire. Personally, I <i>love</i> your dress. Reminds me of
    home.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah. I really miss family, and my room, and all the times I had a chance
    to dance at a <i>ball!</i> Oh, right. The dance is in just a couple days.
    Have you decided who you’re going to ask?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I… Have you ever considered that, maybe, we won’t make it before the
    dance? What if we’re unable to escape this place… <i>ever?</i> I’m sorry,
    but this is a potential truth we have to consider. I don’t think we’ll get
    back in time unless something changes fast. Because <i>nothing</i> is
    working right now.”
    <i>
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t be silly, Lucifer! We’ll make it through this. I <i>know</i> we
    will.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Haha.” He nodded. “Always the very optimistic princess. I’m glad    <i>that’ll</i> never change. I’ve fought countless battles, and seen many
    foes give up hope. And somehow, <i>you</i> never do.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t sell yourself short. If you <i>really</i> thought we were finished,
    you’d have already given up! I know you’re sensible like that.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No. Just <i>hard-headed</i> is all.” He encouraged more laughter.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nadia snuck up on them both, smiling herself. “That’s all well and good.
    But that still begs the question. Who <i>are</i> you going to ask for the
    dance?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Rather, who will <b>you</b> take? No one <i>really</i> expects me to show
    up, damsel in hand. But you? You’re perfect for this sort of thing.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Aha. I’m glad you’re so concerned. But I’ve got a special someone waiting
    for me back in Mistral.” Nadia winked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I know you’ve talked about it in the past, Lucifer. And I want to remind
    you.” Selene said. “An attendee to the dance doesn’t <i>have</i> to be
    romantic. They can fill any role you want them to fill, be it a dance
    partner, or just a good friend to accompany you. Have you thought any more
    about asking
    <i>
        Alecto?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Huh. <i>If</i> I consider that, it’ll rely on her. I’d be more concerned
    about <i>you.</i> You’ll have zero <i>suitable suitors.</i> I don’t mind in
    the slightest. Do you?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    No answer came forth. Even more silence followed as a pile of rocks- the
    precarious shield from the sun, collapsed. The one responsible for treading
    onto the scene was both welcome and detested, forming a bittersweet look
    between Lucifer, Selene, and Nadia.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Alecto. Do you need anything?” Her leader asked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Only a chance to speak, and a promise you’ll listen. </i>
    I spoke with Lady Eleanor about this, and she told me… Sh-She said I should
    be honest with you. I <i>haven’t</i> been. She offered to help me tell you
    guys this, but… It’s my responsibility.”
    <i>
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Do I want to hear this right now? Or should I sit down?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-It’s fine. <i>I</i> need to take a seat more.” Alecto took a deep
    breath. “You probably already guessed this much, but I’m not just a girl
    who likes to pretend she’s a knight. The name <i>Keraseer</i> actually does
    hold weight. Historically, <i>all</i> Keraseers have been powerful knights.
    Nadia, you’re a descendant of Lady Hestia, yes?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Of course. That’s what it <i>means</i> to be an Amaryllis.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Likewise, Keraseers are descendants of a deity named <i>Lord Keres.</i> He
    was not unlike a king. He knew Lady Hestia well, actually. That’s how I
    knew you were an Amaryllis the first time I’d set eyes on you. It came
    naturally.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Really?”</i>
    Lucifer let the implications of her story travel unsaid.
    <i>
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I know what you’re thinking. You’re not a god-fearing warrior. But believe
me when I tell you, Lord Keres is real. Back then, he was one of    <i>five</i> who preceded humanity. He was known as the Slayer-”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The Slayer of Heretics.” Nadia finished.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Should’ve expected an Amaryllis to have done her homework. You know more
    than you let on.” Alecto huffed, amused.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “<i>’Slayer of Heretics.’</i> That’s a cheery name.” Lucifer let out a
    single laugh. “So your great, <i>great, <b>great</b></i> grandfather, with
    possible a few hundred more <i>greats,</i> was a god. If I buy it, that
    makes you part of some sort of <i>clan,</i> does it not? If every Keraseer
    is destined to become a legendary Huntress, or whatever you want to call
    it, how does tradition play into our current predicament?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Heretic</i>
    equals <i>Delphic.”</i> Alecto spelled it out with as few words as
    possible. “My existence is to rid Remnant of as much Grimm as possible. And
    Delphics are the worst of all. They played a part in Keres’ downfall…” Her
    voice caved into despair. <i>“And my own.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer looked back at Selene, then signaled for her to leave. “Go stand
    watch. Make sure there’s nobody listening in.” The reality was, he knew
    she’d find nothing. But whatever Alecto was willing to reveal now might be
    best left hidden for <i>some</i> on Team Lance. Alecto, however, stopped
    them both.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No. I need to be honest with <i>all</i> of you. My…” Tears spilled out
    from under Alecto helmet, prompting her to remove it.
    <i>
        “My family was slain by a Delphic when I was only a child. He… He
        would’ve killed me too if I wasn’t hidden by my- my sister.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    No one said anything, Alecto’s pain being carried to each of them through
    her choked cries. Lucifer was the first to begin coping in his own right.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It wasn’t <i>Nobody,</i> was it?” He sat next to her, showing a rare sign
    of affection by setting a hand on her shoulder. Alecto had expected him to
    give into rage, as ready to break the state of the hideout as he was the
    back of whoever was responsible. Nadia joined his mellow approach.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “N-No. Whoever did it doesn’t look anything like him. <b>He’s</b> just
    another example of why I will <i>never</i> forgive Delphics for what
    they’ve done.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Selene ran in to hug her, a stream of tears trailing down her own face.
    Merlin followed suit. “I-It’s okay. Nothing will <i>ever</i> happen to you
    as long as we’re here! I promise!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “She’s right. Don’t cry. It’s going to be alright. We will protect you.”
    Nadia cheered her up with a signature grin.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I know. After so many years, the Keraseer Kingdom cannot be allowed to
    perish. I am all that remains.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “One day, I’ll help you find the one who did this to you…” Now came the
    expected reaction from Lucifer.
    <i>
        “I will beset onto him the full might of Atlas, and he will suffer
        before <b>you.”</b>
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto sniffled. “I’d never seen him before then, and I‘ve never even seen
    him since. I don’t know <i>who</i> he was. He, um, he wore <i>armor.</i>
    And he used a <i>great-sword</i> similar to my own. It <b>wasn’t</b>
    Nobody. <i>His</i> sword, attire, and voice is completely different…
    Whoever did it might be dead, and I wouldn’t even know.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “But he was older than you, right?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yes. Much older, if I had to guess.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <br/>
    “Then it <i>wasn’t</i> Beleth.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It doesn’t matter.” Her sobbing continued. “A Keraseer has one purpose in
    life: uphold the will of Lord Keres. Delphics are still Grimm. And when my
    family died, I made an oath to purge each and every one I ever came across.
    Remnant <i>needs</i> to be spared the atrocities they’re known to wreak.
    Killing Beleth is just something I <i>need</i> to do.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I, um.” Nadia wasn’t sure what to say. “If we cannot convince you to let
    Beleth go, all <i>I</i> can promise is that I myself will help neither you
    nor him unless it is to save someone’s life. And after what I’ve learned, I
can finally say I understand why you’ve gone this far, but… Beleth<i>can’t</i> be like the one who took your family from you. He’s was a    <i>friend</i> before he was ever a <i>Delphic</i> to me.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer, who had long since retracted his mask, slid it back into place.
    “Affirmative. But I cannot assist you in this. I will go to great lengths
    to stop any bloodshed. I hope you can understand.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I can.” Alecto leaned on his shoulder.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How long ago was this incident?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The hardship in her voice returned. “…Three years ago. I-I was just a
    scared girl who didn’t know how to hold a <i>sword.</i> I was such a
    coward.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“No way!”</i>
    Selene puffed her cheeks out. “There was nothing you could’ve done. Now,
    you’re among the most capable, skilled fighters I’ve ever met! Remember,
    when we first met, I didn’t even know how to activate a <i>semblance.</i>
    Plus, that’s only changed because of you!”

    “Why don’t we just make the most of our situation?” Lucifer said. “Before
    anything bad happens again, why don’t we, you know… Have fun? As a team?”
    It was strange for him, out of everyone, to suggest <i>pleasure</i> before
    business.

    Though everyone <i>knew</i> a storm loomed overhead, ready to crash down
    and plume Team Lance and Blazer into further conflict with each other, they
    were eager to share one last moment of levity. Any act to mirror the
    sentiment was squandered in <b>Summit’s Blight,</b> where four <i>other</i>
    key combatants were primed for an encounter.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Delphic Nobody sat on his knees, sharpening his blade on a translucent
    whetstone. It appeared honing the severity of his death-inducing implement
    was a favorite pastime of his. Few truly knew the <i>Whetstone</i> had an
    archaic relationship with the Beryl Rhinestone. It was almost time for them
to reconvene as they had once before, seeing as Nobody spotted    <i>Nomad.</i> And in the faunus’ hands <i>was</i> the unmistakable
    Rhinestone.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Deer! The Rhinestone! It is mine!”</i>
    Nobody rose, able to peer into Nomad’s eyes despite the shade of his cap.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Nobody. The Moth didn’t send you, did she?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be ridiculous, Deer. I wouldn’t dream of it. It’s time the    <i>Beryl <b>Whetstone</b></i> reunites with the Rhinestone, no? Whoever
    holds both artifacts is rendered immune to the <i>Creatures of Grimm</i>.
    It’s wasted on <i>you.</i> Grimm are <i>Grimm.</i> And should be punished
    as such. I stand for many things, <i>Deer,</i> but I’ve never stood with
    <b>
        them.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “But you <i>are</i> Grimm.” Only Nomad knew his own techniques. He desired
    only to provoke with his evaluation, to test Nobody’s allegiance to the
    faction.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Hold your tongue!</i>
Delphics may have a history of aligning themselves with the goals of their    <i>uncivilized, soulless</i> pets. But my <i>Beloved</i> is proof they can
    still be fair and forgiving.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Are you?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Not a single word came from Nobody, and in return a Beowolf lunged at him
from behind. Few would be able to dodge the cheap shot, but Nobody did it    <i>and</i> cleaved the Grimm in half without lifting a finger.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nomad resumed his speech. “It’s not like a traveler to know the secrets of
    the Rhinestone. That, while being commander of the <i>Whetstone,</i> makes
you a notable target. But if the Moth didn’t send you,    <i>then you have nothing I want.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “And she does? Doubtful. Whatever it is you seek, she will not help you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I do not <b>need</b> her help, nor do I <i>seek</i> it. Speak quickly, for
    many rely on my arrival.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nobody paced back and forth, gesturing for emphasis. “I’ve been thinking.
    There are few in Remnant who possess Kingdom Lore like me. You, being one
    of the few who knew what Delphics were, are more than likely among them. So
    tell me <i>this,</i> Deer. Bringing back those lost, it’s…” He paused.
    <i>
        “It’s a fight without end.”

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “There was once a faunus with horns. He wore <i>bandages-</i> just like
you. And he wore <b>Idol’s Cloak,</b> as you do now. He knew how to    <i>cheat death.</i> Are you him?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nomad knew who Nobody was searching for. Perhaps it <i>was</i> himself.
    Either way, he refuted any knowledge of such an individual. “…No. I am just
    a Lorekeeper, trying to reclaim the past.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Figures. And here I was thinking there could have been some sort of truce
    between us. Ha. An alliance with the <i>faunus.</i> Could I <i>really</i>
    be that desperate?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The thought of Delphics and faunus working as one. Never thought I’d
    experience <i>that</i> again.” Accidentally, Nomad let an aspect of his
    past slip. And Nobody was too keen to miss it.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Again!? You knew a Delphic before me? What was their name!?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>

    Nomad and Nobody whipped their eyes onto a third warlord. He was but a

    Nomad just hoped he was wrong. It was <i>Caligula.</i>

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Silence!”</i>
    Nomad raised a hand. Due in part to Herald and Team Lance’s reports, he had
    acquired a great deal of knowledge regarding Caligula.
    <i>
        “Why are you here? What business do you have in Summit’s Blight,

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    <i>“The Moth Beckons.</i>
She wants your help- and that isn’t me issuing a request. That is a    <b>direct order.</b> But if you refuse, and I’m hoping you do, I will gain
the ultimate privilege. A chance to rid Summit’s Blight of these pests:    <i>faunus and Delphics.</i>”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nobody held a finger forward, making his position crystal clear.
    <i>
        “Tell the Moth there are no allies to be found here!”
        <p>
        </p>

</p>

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The death penalty, then.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nomad crossed his arms. “You’re out of your <i>depth,</i> Caligula. You
    should not have come here. This is your <i>last. Chance. To leave.</i> To
    face us alone is an arrogant choice, one that is certain to be your
    downfall.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Though even he began second guessing himself at the blaring of an airship
    on the horizon.<i> Servus Portum artillery. </i>More concerning though, was
    the mingling of music added to the mix. Not the orchestra affiliated with
    the <b>Choir Battalion,</b> but rather a rude blend of guitar and
    percussion- with lyrics that put any previous attempts at vulgarity to
    shame. Only <i>Caligula</i> knew what this meant.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Hahahahahaha! Whoever said I was <b>alone?”</b> </i>
    He screeched over the blasting of a boom-box. <b>Dimitri</b> held it in one
    hand, the other encased in a bulky apparatus that had a metal hook
    attachment. With this, he was carried onto the scene by the aircraft
    carrier, and as the ginormous ship left, he unlatched himself. During his
    fall, he used the weapon-grappling amalgamation against Nobody to slice off
    a jaw-dropping amount of Aura.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Ya miss me, Mister Grimm?”</i>
    Dimitri chuckled, the music player still hanging from one arm.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, that’s a nice piece!” Caligula remarked as the rowdy rock song
    receded. “High tech <i>Repentance Device,</i> right? One of General
    Victor’s favorites. Surprised he let <b>your</b> greedy mittens near it,
    though.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Not that good ol’ <i>Joe</i> knows! By the way, you might’ve lost a few
    robots on the way here. <i>Oops! Heehee!”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “A mercenary, I presume. What is your name?” Nomad wasn’t intimidated in
    the slightest, even if he may now have reason to.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Are you slow in the head, or something? You’re talkin’ to
    <i>
        the Paragon of Pandemonium! The Harbinger of Havoc! The Great-”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nobody didn’t let him finish. “The Great Madman, Dimitri.” He stepped out
    of the ashes, once again alongside Nomad. Lifting a hand to his face, he
    jerked his chin left and right to crack his neck, understandably stiff from
    the surprise attack. He then spat forward, to the floor. <i>Thunder</i>
    began rolling.
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“The Great- why, yes! You must be a fan! I’m just here cause    <i>‘Extra Supreme’</i> with the funny hat over there promised I’d get a
piece of the pie should I cooperate. Yeah he <i>kidnapped</i> me, but    <i>Salem’s</i> wrath isn’t a much better option for a chap like me. Really,
    it’s a win-win.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nomad, to Nobody’s dismay, rolled his eyes and began leaving.

    “Oh, I think you are!” Dimitri giggled incessantly. It was grating to
everyone’s ears. “Unless you want your little friends of Team Lance in<i>Terra Insanire</i> to settle up- and I can guarantee you, it’ll be    <i>payday</i> very soon!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Caligula answered this time. “The four children attending Beacon Academy
    have trespassed my great city more than once- and there is already no
sanctuary for them. This battle, <b>your</b> death and their retribution at    <b>my</b> hands, will spark the beginning of a golden age for Servus
    Portum- and it all starts with <i>you!</i> Heroes and legends will always
    crumble.”

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    First came Nobody’s duel, which gave him ample chance of gloating while he
disarmed Dimitri. “You must be <i>joking,</i> my dear. You haven’t a<b>chance</b> at beating me. Your ignorant stupor against my    <i>dexterous swordsmanship</i> and <i>allure?</i> I’ve been looking forward
    to this.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Cut</i>
    it out! Kiddo! They don’t call me <i>Vale’s Most Wanted</i> because of my
    hot bod, fresh-mouth. Look at- this is a <i>disgrace!”</i> Dimitri, thanks
    to his own skill and the refusal to unsheathe any swords, was able to pin
    Nobody against a cliff face and teach him the ways of the street. This
    onslaught ended with Dimitri slamming a subset of loose boulders against
    his enemy, trapping Nobody’s arm in the wall. Even he couldn’t deny, Nobody
    wasn’t trying- and he wasn’t distressed in the slightest.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m going to be disappointed when this is all over. Toying with humans who
    think themselves superior? It’s therapeutic.” Even with one hand out of
    commission, Nobody decided to <i>win.</i> Parries and a demonstration of
    his own enhanced, precise approach brought stabs and jabs that threw
    Dimitri off balance. None could blame him for then falling away once a hand
    bashed his head against the wall, through a ditch downward. Inadvertently,
    Nobody doomed the faunus to now combat <i>two</i> crazed cretins.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Not that there was any problem. Without weapons, Caligula was little more
    than an old man with unbelievable stamina. Dimitri seemed the opposite.
    Young, dumb, experienced in the joy of a rough dust-up, but <i>zero</i>
    discipline to speak of. Amazingly, the two made an excellent team. Though
    it wasn’t enough. All that changed when Dimitri reached for the
    <i>
        Repentance Device.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    In order to counter this, Nobody, who was still struggling to pull his arm
    out from the collapsed crevice, took a drastic measure. He unhooked his
sheath, sword, included, and threw it down to Nomad. <b><i>“Deer!</i></b>    <i> If you damage her in <b>any</b> way, you die <b>today!” </b></i>
    <b>
        <p>
        </p>
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For the first time the sword was being unveiled for purposes beyond
    destroying locks or trees, or <i>morale.</i> Though it was unlikely Nomad
    matched whatever <i>Nobody</i> had to offer, he revealed a great deal of
    training with blades. Caligula was forced to employ his own private stash
    of knives and guns just to keep up, while the upgrade from crowbar to
    Repentance Device cornered Nomad to employ exclusively defensive maneuvers.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Be it bullets, electricity arcs, or explosives- Dimitri’s gun, supplied by
    Servus Portum, would’ve been a treat to examine up close if not for who was
    using it. With a number of aerial kicks, he closed enough distance to push
    Dimitri back, into a crater.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    With that, he turned to puncture Caligula through the stomach. Nobody’s
    weapon was sharp enough to not only bypass Aura, but completely empty it.
    All Caligula did in response was pull the sword out of himself, somehow
    unaffected, and throw it aside. It bounced off the edge of Summit’s Blight,
    into a gulley of considerable size.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“No!”</i>
    Nobody broke his arm out of the stone prison in a rage. Though instead of
    chasing <i>Caligula,</i> he chased his brand. That meant a suicidal plunge
    out of the battle, to a fate even Nomad wouldn’t tempt.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Aha! Half your forces are divided now, faunus!” Caligula clapped.
    “Wouldn’t you consider time to retreat? Run back to your <i>horde</i> of
    animals just like you, dare we dream? Oh, I think not. For all the trouble
    you and Herald have put me through, I think keeping you as <i>pets</i>
    would be an apt punishment!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Words mean nothing, tyrant.”</i>
    Nomad looked him dead in the eye without blinking, a flash of determination
    sparkling in his eyes.
    <i>
“Talk, since you clearly love the sound of your own voice. I will        <b>act</b> in the face of damnation. And it’s why you will <b>never</b>
        defeat me. Because I <b>always</b> come back to stand for something.
        What do you stand for? An uncivilized city that’s mocked by <b>real</b>
        kingdoms, and <b>real</b> kings.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Caligula simply laughed under his breath, walking over to the dropped
    Repentance Device. “I stand for the <i>future.</i> A future in which all in
    Remnant can look up, and see the salvation I’ve provided out of the
kindness in my heart. I have no choice. You don’t know my plight, faunus.    <i>And you’ll not live long enough to see it enacted.” </i>A stream of
    volts blitzed out of the canon, intercepting Nomad. Even behind Idol’s
    Cloak, he couldn’t tolerate the relentless assault.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    As the fumes of fried rock and rain subsided, Dimitri galloped to his new
    best friend’s side. “Damn. That push dead-on killed. But not as dead as
    this guy is right now, I’ll tell you that much! <i>Gah- What!?”</i> A
    slobbering <i>Griffon</i> cut through the smoke, somehow having been
    ordered to wrestle with Dimitri, and whisk him into the skies out of
    Summit’s Blight. With his sudden disappearance, a very <i>alone</i>
    Caligula watched Nomad and Nobody parade into view.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    On his own, Caligula lacked the fighting prowess necessary to beat Beacon’s
    first years- let alone the duo ahead. Thus, he needed to tap into a version
    of himself often kept hidden.

<p>
    “In the next life, I hope you have the wits not to anger the <i>beast.”</i>
    Nobody smirked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“…Hahahahahaha! I will show you a <b>beast!”</b></i>
    Caligula burst into a sea of black, slithering arms. In the past, he had
    teased this ability, but <i>now</i> the <b>Infection</b> had fully taken
    over.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nice trick. You’re pretty good!” Nobody had a habit of talking while
    fighting. Or in this case, dodging. The swarm of unknown appendages
swinging around were foolishly assumed to be Caligula’s semblance. “You    <i>have</i> tricks. So you <i>didn’t</i> come unprepared. I thought as
    much. But this power will fail even still. You’ve made a critical error!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Oh? And what’s that?”</i>
    Caligula’s inflection became eerily faint, and hollow.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If your Aura is broken, so is your semblance! And now that I hold the
    so-called <i>‘Repentance,’ </i>you are beaten for the first and last time!
    Because when I am finally satisfied, you’ll be but a stain on the bottom of
    my boot. Make your prayers!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Even after a loaded gauntlet from his own advanced firearm, the Infection
    somehow saved Caligula. Nobody began to believe himself forthright in any
    celebration. It did stun him, though.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“We’re not in Servus Portum anymore, human!”</i>
    He grabbed the autocrat by the neck, and shoved his covered blade between
    the ribs. Anyone would’ve accepted defeat by then. However, not only was
    Caligula still kicking, but his body was as well. That was when he noticed
    the black blood spilling everywhere- the blood of <i>Grimm.</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Ha. Ha. Ha. Are you sure I’m <b>really</b> human?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For once, Nobody fell back, taken off guard. <i>Nomad</i> caught him, and
    the two backed up.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Do you know how Summit’s Blight works, Nobody?” He asked, convincingly
    calm.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Of course. Why bring that up now?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Because that’s our ticket out of here. In approximately <b>ten</b>
    seconds, on <i>this</i> day, the platform on which we now stand will be
    traded out with one far from here. Caligula will be stranded, and we will
    escape.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Escape!? Do you have brain damage? This is our chance to kill that bastard
    for good!” Nobody justified his dash forward.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“’Prohibere!’” </i>
    Nomad declared, holding the Beryl Rhinestone forward. The strange
    incantation froze Nobody and Caligula in place. Neither could move, encased
    in stone, entranced in time. And as predicted, their environment faded into
    that of an old, stale riverbed. Where Caligula stood now was anyone’s
    guess.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What was that about, <i>fool!”</i> Nobody threatened immediately upon
    being released.
    <i>
        “How dare you use the Rhinestone against me? It is mine to hold! It is
        my destiny.”
    </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You believe it possible to kill Caligula. Whatever it was keeping him
    alive, it would’ve only <i>continued</i> to do so. If you wish to return
    and throw yourself at him until you cannot stand, I will not stop you a
second time. You certainly fail to live up to your genius reputation,    <i>‘Grimm Tactician.’</i>” Nomad scoffed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t be ridiculous. If I left as you dared to at the start of this, you’d
    have fallen at the hands of Dimitri, <i>dead.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Are you taking any of this seriously? Or is this really just a game for
    you?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
Nomad turned to watch the sunset. “Interesting words coming from    <i>you.</i> If <b>I</b> could’ve cut down the two of them using that sword,
    I would’ve. I <i>can’t.</i> If <i>you</i> tried, they’d both be so dead,
    they wouldn’t even know it. There’s little doubt you’re admirable with the
    sword. You’re just <i>handicapping</i> yourself. Why hold back all this
    time?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Dimitri and Caligula are too wretched to consider soiling my blade on.
    She’s too good to be wasted on them. Make no mistake. Had I unsheathed her,
    none of you would live past tonight’s moon. There’s no sport in
    slaughtering those who couldn’t defend themselves in a matter like that.
    No. They don’t <i>deserve</i> her time.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Where are you going?” Without turning around, Nomad knew Nobody was
    walking away. A brush of his coat and the adjustment of his collar
    complimented a response.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “To find a new Griffon.” He whipped around, scissoring a feather off a
    nearby bird. He then balanced it on his sword, watching to see which
    direction it fell. <i>North.</i> “It’s decided.” So he headed <i>north.</i>
    <p>

    Ella was last seen asleep. Gratefully guarded within the confines of
Augustus Correctional Facility, sound asleep in the East Wing.    <i>Sector Two-One-Four,</i> in fact. But now she couldn’t even check the
    time as she awoke, in the black nothingness of Idol’s Twilight. This
    would’ve been the <i>third</i> time she was taken here against her will,
    thankfully.

    Her bed dissipated when she stood, only being made of vibrant darkness. The
    wind called to her, leading her towards the horizon. In following it, she
    came upon Terrance- floating unconscious a few feet in the air. In front of
    him studied
    <i>

    Not another phrase was uttered. Ella was quite content to simply stay
    within Idol’s Twilight, savoring the Sweet Regale. Here, everything was
    quiet. As minutes passed by, she began to understand why. Besides the
    pupils, nothing <i>existed.</i> Even the <i>floor</i> was transparent to
    the point of invisibility. She never would have thought it, but a landscape
    filled with <b>nothing</b> was one of the most beautiful things she’d even
    laid eyes on.

    </p>
</p>
<p>

    </p>

<p>
As one might expect, there was a <i>throne room</i> in Servus Portum.    <i>Several</i> were littered throughout the arid, red stretch of obedient
    civilization. The one most frequented by Caligula rested not with the
    people, but in the <i>skies</i> far above. Inside the most well-armed
    blimp, it was kept.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He had not quite recovered from the recent ordeal. Riddled with holes,
    marred with stab wounds, and dripping thick colorless blood, Caligula
    trudged into his main quarters without so much as a brisk pace.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Supreme Leader!”</i>
    Prime Solomon rushed to his side. “Dear god! What happened?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Prime. I have had <i>some</i> day. Leave me be.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If you insist. But, are you alright? Do you need medical aid?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Never better. I’ll walk it off. I always do. Is <i>this</i> my meal?”
    Caligula held his hand out to a vast dining table overflowing with
    luxurious food, rich in taste and quantity. Prime nodded. “The White Fang
    leader Nomad has committed an act of war against me. I want you to do
    something for me.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What do you request of me?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Pick ten faunus slaves at random. Have them beheaded in public. Then,
    remove <i>one</i> tooth from each, and have Aamon deliver them to Nomad.
    Send a message that for every day that he does not surrender to me, I will
    have ten more of his kind executed.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…I’m sorry, Supreme Leader, but I <i>cannot.”</i> Prime contested. “Pass
    the task onto another if you must, but I could <i>never</i> carry out an
    order like that. It isn’t what <i>Claudius</i> would’ve wanted.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“You will be silent, and not speak another word.”</i>
    Caligula chucked a plate piled with pristine cuisine into the wall. At that
    moment, <i>Victor</i> entered the chamber.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It would do you well to listen, Prime. Supreme Leader Caligula knows
    what’s best. To think your judgement succeeds his is the highest form of
    hubris. I have… much to report.” He had hoped a compliment would soften
    whatever punishment would befit his failure. “I was unable to capture nor
    kill <i>Augustus, Ella, or Zara.</i> And… <i>Terrance</i> is no longer
    under my control.”

    “…That is <i>just</i> what I needed to hear today. First the adversaries of
    the Moth turn against me, and now Vale prevails. Before you say something
    else, bring Aamon in here. I’d like to hear his insight on how the mission
    turned so sour.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Of course.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Today’s cost me a lot. I hope it doesn’t cost me my
    <i>
        two best Generals…”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    When Aamon arrived, he quickly began a speech without provocation to avoid
    any interrogations of Zara and his interactions with her. It worked
    wonderfully. “The Purifiers have made exceptional progress on the southern
    front of Summit’s Blight, even if they <i>have</i> come to a standstill
    against the White Fang, unfit to breach the natural barriers. Their
    guerilla tactics have proven effective, and due to the home field
    advantage, our numbers were pushed back today.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So you’re <i>losing.”</i> Victor mocked. “Some help you are.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “My Purifiers will evolve soon enough. Do not be so quick to condemn them.
    We all know how I work.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You <i>work</i> too slowly.” Caligula squashed an apple in his fist. “Fix
    it, now. Or I will <b>deactivate</b> you, and find something
    <i>
        better.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
This was an action Victor, for some reason, could not allow. “There    <i>isn’t</i> something better. You cannot deactivate Aamon. This time, that
    is <i>my</i> choice to make. We <b>need</b> him- <i>I</i> need him to
    expand our long reach. Without him, we cannot adequately serve the Moth.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Prime Solomon countered this with a rejection of Salem’s ideology. “Forget
    her. The Moth should be left alone, and we should leave this delusion of
    conquering Vale behind. She has nothing to offer us!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Other than our own demise!</i>
    <b>I</b>
    am in charge here. <b>I</b> am the Supreme Leader! And if this bickering
    continues, I will have no choice but the replace the lot of you. Do you
    think you are anything special,
    <i>
        Aamon? Victor? You two were <b>nothing</b> when I found you!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The doors opened yet again, and in sauntered the most unwelcome but
    invincible guest of them all, the <i>Seer.</i> Caligula sighed. “Leave me.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Supreme Leader, I beg of you! Reconsider your alliance with Salem! There’s
    nothing to fight for!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “I am ordering you to leave, now.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Prime, Aamon, and Victor quickly marched outside, making sure to lock the
    door behind them. They could only imagine what horrors would soon take
    place inside once Caligula explained how <i>Nomad</i> and <i>Nobody</i>
    eluded Salem even now.
