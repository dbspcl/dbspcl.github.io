<p>
    Her own helmet spied amidst her slumber, hanging on a hook. It was the
    first thing Alecto saw every time she arose in the morning, as it
substituted not only a boost to her motivation, but also a reminder to    <i>put it on.</i> She wouldn’t be caught dead outside this makeshift
    sanctuary without it.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hmm.” She emerged from the bedsheets, yawning, retrieving her weapon from
    under her pillow. Without any visual indication of the sun’s rising nor
    where her scroll sat, time was a true mystery. There was no light inside.
    But for years, she’d developed a natural sense of the hour through sheer
need, and always awoke in a panic at the sun’s ascent. “Grr! Never matter!    <i>This day will fall like the rest! Hya!” </i>The closet door snapped
    open. Surely another one of Alecto’s coveted kicks.
    <i>
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ah! Do you ever try the knob? Anything other than a normal entrance
    probably damages the door.” Selene grinned. It was a certainty that the
walls shielded fellow students from everything, including Selene’s singing,    <i>except</i> the roughhousing and commotion Alecto was known for. But her
    sleeping quarters couldn’t hide from the Knight the fact that she
    interrupted another vocal exercise. Even through the door, Selene’s melodic
    voice was enchanting.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That <i>was</i> a normal entrance. Would you like to see a crazy one?”
    Alecto set a hand on the nearby sword and lowered her visor.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Can we please <i>not</i> break the door?” Lucifer said. Straight from
    Beacon’s Library, he had a mug of coffee for himself. When Alecto asked for
    it, he folded in record time.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How about I break you instead?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Save it for the Grimm.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s what I’m best at, really. The day I lose to a Grimm is the day I’ll
    finally shut my mouth for good-“
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Can that day be <i>today?”</i> He sighed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No way! Today we’re going to have fun! Say goodbye to outside meddling and
    hello to team bonding!” Selene cuddled Merlin, cross-legged on her
    blankets.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Besides going on adventures, perfecting teamwork, and mocking each other,
    what do we do for fun anyway?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Team Blazer does all kind of wacky stuff. It’s to be expected when you’ve
    got two rivals, a faunus hook-slinger, and a scarecrow. I even hear they
    have board games. Sometimes, the yelling can be heard from here.” Selene
    joked.
    <br/>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We’ve got to have something in here to match that! There’s no way I’m
    getting shown up by a bunch of weaklings!” Alecto ruffled through some
    nearby drawers, eventually succumbing to the bottom-most one in a desperate
    attempt to cling onto victory. But unlike the last couple, this trunk held
    something far more special than notebooks, clothes, dust, or assorted
    trinkets. It sheltered the prized <i>black knight pieces</i> from
    initiation. “…Hey guys, remember these?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How could I forget? And believe me, I try.” Lucifer grunted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Aw, c’mon. It wasn’t that bad. Sure we had a feud of sorts, but without it
    we wouldn’t have formed such a great team. It was there we killed our first
    Grimm together. The Grover deserved as much mercy.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Selene and Merlin exchanged glances, recalling the distant events as
    provoked. “Yeah, and that was the first time I’d killed a Grimm, period.
    This <i>little guy</i> did most of the work, granted.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hey! Without me you would have never reached the temple. Though, without
    that first kill of yours, we’d be toast. Who am I kidding, one single Grimm
    is no match for me!” Alecto quipped.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Except for that Nevermore. You can thank my haste for your assembly, and I
    suppose I can too. Admit it though, I had you beat up there.” The leader
    joined in.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Please.</i>
    I let you win. What am I saying, you didn’t win! You cheated, and ran away.
    A real warrior would have joined me in the fall!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No thanks. I saved my energy for Grover, and-“
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “And <i>me.</i> You tackled me, remember?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I mistook you for an enemy. It happens a lot.” He smirked under the mask.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Whatever. We took out Grover, and got these! As a team.” She held up one
    of the two knights. “That means something. You were there, Selene was
    there, I was there, and…” She caught herself, watching the gap of dust
    outline where the trophy was.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “She’s still part of our memories, and vice versa. We’ll never forget her,
    no matter what.” Lucifer walked over to ensure Nadia’s bed was made, and
    all her robes were neatly folded.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re finally starting to sound regretful.” Alecto sassed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Regretful?</i>
    Of course I am… What do you think I’m doing right now? I want her things to
    be in order for when she comes back… <i>Argh, forget it!</i> She’s never
    coming back!” He gave up and swept his arm across the covers, scattering
her mattress into a state of disrepair. “How could I be such a    <i>fool!?</i> She’s gone because of me. I just wish, considering how fond
    those memories between all four of us are, we could have made a few more.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well, we can always form new ones. Let’s make memories <i>together.</i>
    There’s nothing in here, so why don’t we crash by Team Blazer?” Selene sat
    up and stretched.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Let’s do it.” Alecto returned the chess piece onto its dust-surrounded
    footprint, whereupon she realized there was no <i>second</i> piece. The
    other knight bonding Team Lance together was missing. “Wait a second. Where
    did the other piece go?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s not there?” Lucifer looked into the drawer himself.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Do you think Nadia took it with her?” Selene asked, worried but mostly
    unconcerned.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s impossible. I saw to her departure, she left straight from the
    dorms rooms. If she came back, someone would have seen her.” Alecto
    explained.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Then it’s somewhere in here, just waiting to be found. It’ll let up. Time,
    however, will <i>not.</i> We should drop by Team Blazer now if we want to
    do anything before class begins.” A solemn but hopeful order from Lucifer
    had the entire cabin’s residence jostling towards their neighbors.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You and Beleth love to ham it up in this regard, but have you ever thought
    it necessary to include me!? Never, not out of respect, but <b>fear!</b> So
    go ahead, throw whatever you’ve got at me, It’ll only fuel my wrath!” Rade
    wheezed, entangling his fingers with Lexy’s for an arm-wrestling challenge.
    Beleth simply laughed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I can’t wait to see what happens next. If I said something like that,
    she’d rip my head off.” He jeered with excitement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Err… A-Are you sure you want me to try my hardest? I do this kind of thing
    a lot, and you look kind of… <i>Frail.”</i> Lexy took a brisk peek at his
    supposedly atrophied muscles.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t try to get out of this! I know you’re <b>afraid,</b> but that’s the
    point! Facing that which terrified you most is the key to overcoming it. So
    if I <i>scare</i> you, all you have to do is repent!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Fine. You asked for it. One, two, three, go!” She started the test of
    strength. Not quite on board with crushing him, but aware of her own
    modesty, Lexy decided to let him struggle for a couple seconds. Beleth
could only imagine her surprise when Rade’s hand plummeted in the    <i>wrong direction,</i> instantly signifying a surrender.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “<i>W-What!? Did he just eliminate himself?” </i>He thought.
    <i>
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“…Damn.”</i>
    Rade couldn’t believe it. He was petrified, frozen in shock, when a swarm
    of knocks invaded. Beleth sailed up, opened the door, and then leapt back
    on the bed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Arm-wrestling!? And nobody invited me? Move over, <i>bag of bones!”</i>
    Alecto flipped a still stunned Rade out of the way and took his place. He
    fell completely limp on the floor.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Really, you’re going to challenge <i>me,</i> Alecto? You couldn’t even
    beat fiddle-boy <i>Beleth</i> in a fight, what gives you the idea you can
    hold a candle to me?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hey!” The target of ridicule couldn’t let Lexy’s fleeting jabs go
    unnoticed. <i>“Grr!</i> Let’s have it then! One, two, three, go!” Alecto
    grabbed ahold of Lexy’s hand and began the grappling-match. Every member of
    each respective team, despite missing one each, rallied behind their
    contenders. The participants growled at each other, struggling with no
    clear champ.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, I see. My technique was all backwards.” Rade sat up and catalogued
    what was assumed to be <i>notes</i> in the Fear Index. A sudden leap in
    stakes acted as the culmination of their competition. Aggravated with the
    stalemate, Lexy pulled in a way such that both her and the assailant were
    force onto their feet.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t think so, I’m not letting go!” Alecto jerked her hand back,
    flipping Lexy into a somersault. She landed on her heels, also
    understanding that loosening their grip would constitute forfeit. With
    that, both twisted each other into repeated gymnastics through the
    hallways.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Well considering I bought a metal table so the arena couldn’t break like
    usual, I didn’t think there were any other ways to end arm-wrestling
    besides <i>ending</i> it. Clearly, she’s outsmarted me.” Beleth hit his
    violin-bow on his hand a few times.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t think I’d be any good at arm-wrestling anyway. You guys have other
    games, right?” Selene justified Lucifer’s search through the nearby
    cabinets.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s right! Take for example this one. I imported it straight from home,
    it’s simple but the best games always are!” Rade pulled out the proclaimed
    classic. On the surface it appeared only as a stack of blocks slotted into
    each other within a box. He set it on the table then slid the cardboard
    off, forming a perfect assemblage of intertwined wooden bricks. “We pull
    out a block in turns, and if the rest fall, you’ve lost.”

    “Wouldn’t you be inadequate at it since you’re all twitchy?” Lucifer
    remarked.

    “Have a look for yourself, <i>Lucy!”</i> Rade poked out one of the lower
    slabs without issue. In order of team members, with home court advantage
    belonging to Blazer, they dismantled the tower until it seemed one more
    move would bring certain defeat. “I should probably wake Zara. It takes her
    a couple minutes to get going in the morning, unless of course she’s late.
    In that case, she springs into action like a butterfly fresh from her
    cocoon! But she does enjoy a gentle few minutes extra sleep. Let’s see if I
    can revoke of her of that with compromise.” Rade shuffled over Lexy’s bed
    out the window, but only after arming himself with the pitchfork.

    </p>

<p>
    “This can only end well.” Beleth left the desk in a hurry. This exact
    scenario may have already happened a handful of times.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Am I allowed to take blocks off the top?” Selene didn’t have a clue how to
    approach this teetering disaster of a game.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Negative. But remember, the rules of <i>war</i> dictate that when loss is
    imminent, you must cut them. If you truly believe yourself or your armies
    annihilated, throwing in the towel might just save what remains… I’m just
    joking, pull out that one.” Her mentor gave her a blatant hint.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You can’t tell her what to do. That’s cheating.” Beleth twiddled his
    thumbs, watching from a distance.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re not even playing anymore. If you are, get back over here and resume
    your post. Why are you out of position to begin with?

<p>
    Shudders and panes were swept aside, a furious ball of chaos tearing
    through. Zara and Rade were locked together, swinging each other around due
    to some unknown intrusion crafted by the fork-flinging maniac. The game
    ended with a bang. Zara tangled Rade straight into the balanced pillar, and
    the resulting clash spewed chunks of wood around the room.

    <p>

    “What is wrong with you!? Waking me up with a <i>pitchfork!?”</i> She
    hollered.

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“’Pinch me, I must be dreaming,’</i>

    bursts.

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well that’s the end of that, isn’t it?” Beleth applauded. “It was your
    turn when it toppled, I think that means you lose, Selene.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>

    “But Rade’s the one who knocked it down.” She protested.

<p>
    <i>“Slander!</i>

<p>
    “What!? I have a name, you know!” The heat from her eyes could be felt
    across the room.

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Okay, <i>Zara,</i> but just remember, there’s plenty to insult me over.
    Just look at me! I’m a freak that holds no grudges.”

    </p>

<p>

    </p>

<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Great indeed! But also a freak. And if you knew where I came from, you’d

    The next batch of returning fighters blasted back into the bedroom. Lexy
    and Alecto, still tussling, migrated back where the dissention began.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re pretty strong, bucket of bolts! What would you need all that metal
    for other than to play pretend?” Lexy taunted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s far more functional than high heels and lip-gloss. It could be worse
    though, you could be a Grimm. Then I’d put you down for good!” Alecto
    retorted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The only thing getting put down is my fist in your face!” The comeback
    sounded far better in Lexy’s head. Selene couldn’t help but giggle. “And
    that armor might as well be for show for all the good it’ll do!” Lexy
    taunted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh no. Lexy just insulted her armor.” Lucifer nudged Selene’s shoulder.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ladies, ladies. Cool down, there’s no need for a catfight!” Beleth
    strutted between them in perhaps the worst tactical move done that day
    alone.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Shut it. I’d gladly strike down Grimm, cretins wearing drama masks, or
    robots run-amuck from Servus-<i>whatever.</i> Fortunately you, nor you are
    none of those.” She pinned first Beleth, then Lexy with the tip of her
    blade.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah, what makes <i>you</i> think you can join in? Did you get an
    invitation?” Lexy tapped her team leader by the shoulder.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Heh, heh, wait a minute. I didn’t sign up to get tag-teamed here. Not that
    I can’t handle two women at once, mind you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Place your bets now! Who’ll win? A hothead in every sense of the word, a
    swords-woman with fake horns- I appreciate the real deal,” Rade patted Zara
    on the back. “Or the <i>De-</i> Ahem.
    <i>
        Violinist.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Forget that. This one’s a duet, not a solo act. Get over here, Alecto.”
    Lexy called for a
    <i>
        two-verses-one.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p align="right">
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You got it, girl. This brother‘s going <i>down.” </i>She didn’t have any
    reservations about switching sides. Beleth believed himself capable enough
    of attracting backup too, though.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Let’s hype up the bass and even the odds, Lucifer. The crowds are going to
    love it! A good ol’ fashion battle of the bands. What say you? Beleth and
    Lucifer, greatest heroes Sanus has ever seen!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>

    “…Affirmative.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Wait, really?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Of course. Except for the whole team-up part. That’s a negative.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What? Why?” Alecto was beginning to warm up to a second round.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Because it’s nine o’clock.”

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>“What!?</i></b>
    <i> What are we doing here? <b>Move!”</b></i>
    Zara pushed everyone aside in pursuit of the classes. The rest of her team
    jogged after her, but Team Lance waited for Lucifer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Shouldn’t we get going?” Selene watched him close the window and grab
    ahold of Rade’s weapon.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Class will begin five minutes late, that’s been the case ever since
    Professor Penelope joined our ranks. I mainly just said that to diffuse the
    fight. But if we went ahead with it, we <i>would</i> be late. Not to
mention someone needs to take care of the mess they made. Look at    <i>this-</i> why are their weapons even here? They should be in the
    lockers.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Correct me if I’m wrong, but everyone on your team besides <i>you</i>
    carries their weapons around with them. Occasionally I’ll hide away the
    Keraseer Heirloom, but this beauty <i>means</i> something to me.” She
    twirled the epee in circles.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Okay. I’m sane, your short-sword is valuable, and Selene relies on her
semblance which, might I add, needs more training. But what could Rade    <i>possibly</i> need this pitchfork for at all times? It was even sitting
in his sleeping bag, so he goes to <b>bed</b> with it. Why is it even    <i>on</i> the ceiling fan?” Lucifer gestured to the obscene sight. His two
    watchers snickered at the longwinded rant. “Maybe we can ask them. C’mon.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    As predicted, class had not yet begun.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Professor Penelope snoozed away in front of everyone, her students patient
    enough not only to let her sleep several minutes past the normal
    instructional period, but also use that time to speak amongst themselves.
    Their teacher was leaning forward and blurting out a stream of muted snores
    along with the common pillow sack draped over her head, which was then
    propped up on one arm. She was out cold.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Do you think we should wake her up?” Terrance whispered.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Boreas “No. Rather, we should, but nobody’s going to want to take the fall.
    And that applies to me. Whoever pipes up is buying themselves a one-way
    ticket to <i>scold-ville. </i>Population: one- the guy who tattles.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Tattles?</i>
That’s not tattling. Who’s being told on and for what? <i>Everyone</i> for    <i>existing?”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“I must do something about this. <i>But how?</i> What about…    <i>Yes, <b>Rhinestone!</b></i> It is the only way!” Boreas brandished the
    violet antique before realizing secrecy was the entire premise of his
    gripes. “Even through all my taming, I cannot fully control the Stone. I
    may be able to contain and direct its power but I need a catalyst to begin
    the blast and jolt her up.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I have absolutely <i>no</i> idea what you’re going on about.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Plenty of things can prompt a response.
    <i>
        Grimm, broken Aura, copious amounts of dust- red specifically, and
        inactivity
    </i>
    are the most noteworthy ones respectively.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Okay. I’ve got some dust on me. Yellow dust, but it’s still dust.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What’s that you got there?” Beleth tiptoed over to Boreas. “Still playing
    with that piece of rock?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Boreas opened his mouth to retort in defense of the Beryl Rhinestone, but
    he was at full attention once it instinctively began vibrating in his
    hands. He couldn’t complain, he achieved his energy explosion. And with the
    refined ability to wrangle reactions of this type, a gust of rushing air
    stirred Penelope. She shifted under the pillowcase thanks to some sturdy
    yawns. Boreas paused, then looked Beleth in where his eyes <i>would</i> be.
    “…I see. That <i>lightning dust</i> really does the trick.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hmm. Huh? Oh… Hm!” Penelope lifted the cloth shawl onto her forehead. One
    more yawn, and she was ready to initiate the seminar, drowsy as she was.
    “Welcome back everyone, I hope you all had a productive evening since our
    last meeting. You’ve probably already noticed, but Professor Stam was
    unable to make it. There’s been an alarming amount of Grimm attacks in
    Forever Fall, and he was chosen among others to defend the outlying
    territories. I was told by him that, at this time, civilians have been
    advised to stay indoors. But that’s hardly going to stop a bunch of
    learning Huntsmen and Huntresses, is it?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Penelope was far less brash and assertive than Stam, although it didn’t
    seem to matter in regards to herding the audience. They all stopped to
    listen in contentment. “Class is already behind, clearly, and Stam’s not
    here to instruct it. I don’t know about you, but I like his hands off
approach. In fact, I think it’d be a good idea to take it even    <i>further.</i> We’ll make this a free day. How does that sound?” Nobody
said anything back. “…What, nothing? Fine, how about we write an essay?”    <i>That</i> finally garnered a response, albeit an adverse one. “That’s
    what I was looking for. Presumably you’d do some work, perhaps spar, you
    can even <i>leave</i> if you want, I guess. Most of you would probably just
    socialize anyway. Why keep you <i>here</i> for that?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Yes!</i>
    The search continues!” Terrance sprinted out in the ensuing murmurs. Within
    a few short minutes the only remaining inhabitants were Team Lance and
    Boreas, who was already committed to a day of studies. Alecto, following a
    moment of terse conversation, marched away from the lectern to request
    something from the teacher.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Professor Penelope, if we can, we were thinking about staying for
    semblance training. We either do it here, or we do it at the practice
    grounds.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Sounds good to me. Anything to improve your skill, right? A developed
    semblance can be enough to save you, I know that firsthand. Sure it goes
    offline if your Aura breaks, but with proper preparation the fight
    shouldn’t go that haywire.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What is your semblance, anyways? I’ve never seen you use it.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “There are reasons for that. I can’t show you, and I’d rather not talk
    about it.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Boreas walked over, rambled, and read all at the same time. “Well, I can
    make a few guesses. You see, I’ve studied the nature of semblances
    extensively, and I have reason to believe it’s tied to two things.
    Emotions, and personality. One variable tied to the moment at hand, another
    permanently set in stone within the host. I have great suspicions what’s
    commonly known about semblances are false, possibly my theory included.
    These are just estimations.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto scratched her helmet. “So Lucifer’s semblance, based on personality,
    is the ability to annoy everyone within a three-hundred foot radius? That’s
    not too bad actually, he could pester his enemies to death just by
    talking.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I wish it was that simple.” Lucifer said.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How about instead of worrying about your semblance, or the Professor’s, we
    worry about mine? I’m getting really close to achieving something great, I
    can feel it!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Let’s have it, then. Alecto?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Begin!” She said. Selene stretched, prepared herself, and summoned the
    recognizable portal.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Incredible!” Boreas tended to the mist-filled vessel, quelling the
    Rhinestone by forcing it into a secure pouch. “This blasted thing is
    starting to get on my nerves, and probably your nerves too! If it doesn’t
    cool down, it’ll have to find solace in a rocket-locker instead!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Anything to keep it in check, where it won’t get lost again and force us
    on a retrieval mission for the umpteenth time. If we’re extra lucky, it’ll
    get lost in this void.” Lucifer waved his hand around the smoke. Alecto
    burst into another tirade.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Nothing is allowed in there you idiot, remember? There’s no entry for us,    <i>that</i> privilege goes to the skeletons.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Skeletons? You’re telling me skeletons come out of there? If that’s true,
you have some of the greatest potential I’ve <i>seen</i> in a semblance.    <i>Exquisite!</i> Show me the skeletons.” Boreas declared.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Your wish is my command! Just let me concentrate… Aha!” She paused, closed
    her eyes, tensed her hands, and then put everything she could into
    assembling an apparition without incentive. The wait may not have been
    worth it, as all that hovered onto the ground was another bony hand. Boreas
    quickly assessed it for himself, using a magnifying glass to inspect every
    detail, as trivial as it may seem.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “A <i>hand. </i>A hand, yeah?” He wasn’t very impressed, that was until it
    began articulating itself. <i>“What in the!?” </i>It reached for his face,
    latched onto his arm, then refused to let go. It took but a fraction of his
    strength to tear it away, but just that much was a burdensome test.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s moving!? H-How!?” Alecto clapped. “All that we’ve managed thus far
    was the odd prone limb! I can’t believe it! I’ve never seen someone develop
    so quickly!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “And it’s all thanks to you, Alecto. Thank you.” Lucifer offered her a
    handshake.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Really, that’s it? A handshake? No hug?” She accepted his proposition but
    couldn’t forego further insolence.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t hug people, in case you haven’t noticed. Be grateful you got as
    much as you did.” Right after condemning the act, he kneeled down to hug
    Selene. “But seriously, thank you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah! Without you, we would never have gotten this far!” Selene nodded.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-It’s nothing, really. Anything for you two. Don’t get ahead of
    yourselves though, a hand is one thing. You’re still nowhere near combat
    ready.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The skeleton fist slipped away from Boreas’s clutches onto the main table
    where Stam normally sat. Penelope had dozed away again, completely ignorant
    of the recent events, but the newcomer was more than willing to scare her
    back into the real world in as rough a manner as necessary, its motives a
    pure mystery.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “H-huh? Gah!” She reacted as anyone would have if a disembodied vestige of
    a hand tapped their arm. Dreamcatchers didn’t generally act as weapons, but
    her staff was styled as one, always nearby and now firmly in her grasp.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t worry, it’s from Selene’s semblance. I <i>think</i> it’s friendly.”
    Alecto watched the topic of discussion scurry back to the floor and run
    circles around Merlin.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh. Creepy. So her semblance is what, necromancy?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Come to think of it, is there any evidence what, or who, you’re raising
    was alive at some point? <i>Is</i> this manipulation of the dead?” Boreas
    pulled out a pamphlet on the subject. He somehow had a tool for every job
    hidden in his many coats.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Um…” Selene met Lucifer’s eyes, and they both caught Merlin’s stare.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “There’s no evidence of that.” He declared.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What do we call this thing? Semblances usually have a name, but in the
    instance of a summon-type ability, people like naming the spirit.” Boreas
    broached the subject. “Her powers seem to be some sort of <i>necromancy</i>
    variant. Not quite, if what you say is true, but we’re still dabbling in
    skeletons. No matter the specifics, the warriors we’ll eventually call are
    the result of this power, a <i>Necrocyst,</i> if you will.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So, we’re beckoning <i>Necrocysts?</i> That can’t be right, those are
    reserved for a special someone in Kingdom Lore. How do you know about
    those?” Alecto wrapped her head around his suggestion.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I caught a peek in Stam’s private library. You’re right, Necrocysts were a
    type of hoplite that sacrificed themselves for an ancient king. But if
    Selene sticks to one individual, it’s best that one gets a name to set it
apart from the rest. I think it’s preferred we do that. Start small,    <i>then</i> maybe think about a dual ensorcell.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How about this. So as not to disrespect the <i>‘King,’ </i>we can name
    Selene’s guardian Necrocyst but with a modifier, something unique to her.
    Like, <b>Royal Necrocyst,</b> or something.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Royal Necrocyst…</i>
    I like it!” Selene approved.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I just had an interesting thought.” Boreas put away all his equipment. “If
we’re not tapping into the dead, could this really be a gate to    <i>another <b>dimension?</b></i> Or, at the very least, a location? I’d
    heard of semblances of that type, but never seen one myself. In these
    cases, I believe the beneficiaries are <i>tied</i> to an unknown area in
    Remnant. Those books in the library made mention of it. I’d once read up on
    a mythological figure who had access to an empty void, and he used it to
    escape attacks.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m familiar. His name was <i>Kyradin Bael.</i> That guy could walk in and
    out himself, though. How are we supposed to get this thing back in the
    portal?” Alecto redirected the discussion back to training.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Let me try.” Selene focused once again, and with some struggling the hand
    carried itself by all five digits into its home and fell inside.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Wow, so you’ve got some aspect of control over it. Great job! What do you
    say, Lucifer? I think that milestone’s enough for today.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I guess so. We’re free to go, right Professor Penelope?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Huh!?” She jarred awake. “Oh, of course. You have been this entire time.
    Actually, since you five are the only ones still here, and you’ve decided
    to spend your time productively, how about some extra credit?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, please!” Alecto saluted, chomping at the bit for more points, willing
    to do <i>anything</i> in order to get them.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’ve got it. Feel free to drop by any time.” She closed her eyes to
    resume her nap. For her, peace was always found in the pleasure of a brief
    rest. But not everyone was able to flank their problems by switching off,
    some could only flee. One such student had long since ran away, and was now
    standing at the final threshold between Vale and Mistral.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nadia extended her metal nails back and forth in an alternating pattern
    just to keep herself busy. <i>“Ten minutes past sundown,”</i> she told
    herself. That was when her train was scheduled to leave. She couldn’t stop
    watching the board with all the times posted, nervous to make the final
    step and return home. How many times she snuck a glimpse at the large
    display which she slowly began to hate didn’t matter, it was <i>this</i>
    one that had her noticing the adjacent poster.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“The Vytal Festival.” </i>
    She read it out then buried her face in her hands, mumbling to herself
    <i>
        . “You were supposed to be a part of that, Nadia. You were supposed to
        be better. What are you doing?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You could always join them, Miss Flora. It’s never too late to return to
    my classroom!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Who- <i>Stam!?”</i> She couldn’t believe her eyes. “What are you doing
    here? How did you find me?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“This happens to be only one of <i>two</i> stations that lead to Mistral’s    <i>main</i> travel ports, in which I believe you arrived, no? The other is
    lost to a short detour through Forever Fall, which is under heavy guard at
    this time. Do correct me if I’m wrong, but this is the same train you took
    to reach Vale the <i>first</i> time. The long journey from here to the
    Kingdom is arduous enough to take once, let alone twice! Why <i>have</i>
    you left Beacon Academy?’
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…I had a big fight with my team, and I just didn’t feel welcome anymore…”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…That’s it?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“It’s just… Lucifer was bossing me around, and he made me feel…    <i>worthless</i>. He said Team Lance weren’t my real friends.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Miss Flora, we’ve all had disagreements with our allies. I can’t even
    begin to recount my own. Believe me when I tell you that there are many
awaiting your return, and the meltdown between you and your captain was a    <i>minor</i> setback, caused by mounting tensions. In a way, your tactics
    are admirable! Mister Virtus heard the message loud and clear, trust me on
    that one. I’d even say he’s ready to change! And you know better than
    anyone, Mister Virtus simply has a short temper. It runs in the family.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Selene never treated me like that, though.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Their relationship is more complicated than you know. That’s something you
    need to ask <i>him</i> about back at <i>Beacon.” </i>Stam fixed his hat.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Do you think I overreacted? I-I can’t go back now. I’ve been gone for so
    long. How can I face my team after everything that’s happened?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “As they will face you, with open arms. Without you, Team Lance is lost.
    They will be unable to compete in the Vytal Festival. I was personally
    looking forward to commentating your rounds, as was Professor Penelope.
    It’s always been a pleasure for everyone involved. Is there a more
    appropriate way to start the festival than with Mistral and Atlas coming
    together? Not to mention, I’d still like to see you take measures to
    welcome others, rather than dismiss them. I know you’re shy, but as long as
    you accept Beacon, they’ll accept you. And… If you return, I’ll stop
    pestering you to sit in the front row. Haha!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Heh. And Team Blazer was pretty fun, too. They’re probably as ashamed of
    me as I am. I doubt they even realized I’m missing.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The choice is yours. I understand things seem pretty rough now, but one
    day, you’ll be regretful you never took all the chances and opportunities
    given to you. Take it from me. I spoke with Warden Augustus in Forever
    Fall, and he asked me if you were coming back. Ella was wondering the same
    thing. Everyone wants to know where you are.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m sorry, Professor Stam-“
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ho! There’s no need to call me that, Miss Flora. If your days in Beacon
    Academy truly are numbered, then I am your professor no more. I should
    really be going! The Grimm aren’t going to be fighting themselves, are
    they? Just always remember to keep your chin up, never stop smiling. It was
    my favorite thing about you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Thanks, Professor- Rather… I-I never did find out your first name.” Nadia
    held out her hand to cement their farewell.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Another story for another time.” Stam took the first step back. “Oh, one
    other thing. I thought it would be a waste to leave Vale after everything
    with nothing to show, so Headmaster Ozpin helped me gather <i>this</i> for
    you.” He handed her the missing chess piece from her dormitory.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Th-The Black Knight!” It glinted in her hands just as it had when she
    first acquired it. All the memories trampled over her. A shower of
    nostalgia, sentimentality, and remorse said more than Stam ever could. She
    pulled back her hood, lost.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Your team’s been looking for you, by the way. They miss you.” Professor
    Stam hid his hands in his pockets and tramped away. As he departed, the
    train took his place. Its classic chugging and iconic horn popped Nadia out
    of her stupor. <i>It was now or never.</i> She could leave to Mistral, back
    to a familiar world without prior conflict, or venture from whence she’d
    come and reunite with every acquaintance made in recent memory.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The shattered moon loomed overhead, casting shadows wherever she went. At
    least <i>that</i> wasn’t going anywhere.
