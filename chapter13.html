    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i> “Awesome?</i>
    No, I already used that too much.” Nadia mumbled, leaning on her arm,
    struggling to find the right word. “Hey, Alecto, what’s a synonym for the
    word <i>‘lovely’</i>?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Huh. <i>Killing Grimm!</i> Now that’s lovely!” She scooped the curtains
    aside, letting light into their dorm room. Upon Lucifer’s return, she
    snatched his cup of coffee away.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Um. I don’t think I can write that down here.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How about maiming Grimm?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
Nadia sighed. “So I’m describing Terra Insanire, and I’m trying to say    <i>‘the view is lovely!’</i> But I already used that word. I just need to
    find an alternative, but I can’t write <i>‘The view is maiming Grimm.’</i>
    Do you understand?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto paused. “Torturing Grimm!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-I’m sorry. I’m not going to substitute <i>lovely</i> with <i>killing</i>
    Grimm, or <i>torturing</i> Grimm, or <i>anything</i> having to do with
    Grimm. Let’s take grimm out of the picture.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Lucifer? What’s a synonym for Grimm?” Alecto asked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Ugh.” His face was in his hands. “Nadia, just use the word <b>nice,</b> or    <b>beautiful</b>, or <b>pretty.</b> In fact…” He rifled through their one
    of their drawers. “Aha! Here, just use a thesaurus.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Isn’t that a type of dinosaur?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Aren’t <i>Keraseers</i> supposed to be smart?” He mocked, then dodged a
    lamp.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Just joking! That was a joke!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I need quiet!” Nadia complained. “It is of upmost importance that these
    letters be completed. They’re supposed to be sent out once a week.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer leaned against the wall. “Yet you still can’t tell us who they’re
    going to? Uh-huh.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nadia opened her mouth to say something, but opted to turn the other cheek.
Alecto scurried over to coach her on the <i>correct</i> response.    <i>“Psst!</i> I gotcha! See that cup there? Throw it at him!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Like this?” She lobbed the cup forward, underhanded. It flew the air and
    bounced off Lucifer’s armor. He didn’t even bother tending to such a limp
    toss.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No! Like this! <i>Hya!”</i> Alecto demonstrated a <i>proper</i> pitch with
    the unplugged alarm clock.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This time, Lucifer plucked it out of the air. “Nadia, don’t let her corrupt
    your mind with talk of rebellion. You’re a bright star in this team. You
    smile more than any of us. Keep it that way.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    At hearing this, Nadia couldn’t <i>help</i> but smile. However, Selene
overheard the comment as she skipped out of the washroom. “She is    <i>not!</i> I smile way more, see?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Smiling competition!” Alecto cheered. “Fight to the death, right now!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Both Nadia and Selene laughed. It didn’t last. A cacophony of firm knocks
    rattled the door. Whoever it was didn’t know their own strength. Lucifer
    resumed the role of greeter, opening the door. There were few tall enough
    to force him into looking <i>up</i> thereafter.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Boreas?” He questioned. “Why are you so tall? Would you mind, rather,
    standing on your knees?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…If it makes you more comfortable.” The alchemist obliged, though he was
    now only a hair shorter than Lucifer, and still leagues above anyone else
    in the room.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What do you want?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I just came here to check in. And, of course, to send a message. There was
    an extra-credit assignment Professor Penelope requested I deliver to you.
    Here.” Boreas offered a sheet of crumpled paper upon which the back had
    four words sloppily scrawled.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“’Write your biggest fear.’” </i>
    Lucifer read it out. “Take it back. Out of my way.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Before you ask, <i>yes</i> he did pay me to do that.” Boreas climbed back
    to his normal towering stature and followed Lucifer over to Blazer’s dorm
    one room over. He whacked the door a couple times until Beleth answered.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Where’s Rade?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Huh?” Beleth sputtered.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Rade. He bribed this, this <i>gentleman,”</i> Lucifer gestured to the
    mountainous Boreas. “To give me this paper and tell me it was extra credit.
    Where is he? I’m sick of these games.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ha. He left a couple hours ago to Terra Insanire. My guess? He went to
    squeeze some information out of Troy. But he might’ve also fled
    <i>
        you.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer turned, smirking at Boreas, not that anyone could tell under his
    metal suit. “Well, then. Let’s go pay the scarecrow a visit. I’ll need the
    Rhinestone.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Very well. Just make sure it stays in one piece, or <i>you</i> won’t.”
    Boreas handed it over.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t lie. You just want to go training for the Vytal Festival.” Alecto
    noted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Affirmative. But who’s to say we can’t kill two birds with one bullet? I
    get to train, <i>and</i> interrogate that scrawny twerp. All in a day’s
    work, of course. Who knows, maybe we’ll get to slaughter some Grimm.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Let’s go.” Alecto blasted away, one step ahead of everyone as long as it
    involved the destruction of Remnant’s most prehistoric adversary.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The warning of Lance’s boss met the rest of Team Blazer without trouble.
    “We’re going to Terra Insanire. If you want to come with, be my guest.
    Unless you’re <i>scared,</i> like Rade.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, he is <i>so</i> gonna get it!” Lexy stomped. “Get back here you
    weasel! Rade’s not scared of you! He’s not scared of <i>anybody…”</i> The
    tirade petered out as everyone but Zara and Boreas paraded towards the
    entrance to a specific mass of cracked cliffs and chasms.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Later.” She waved Boreas goodbye, crossing the passages towards the
    elevators.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Is something the matter, Zara?” He stopped her. The Thinker was keen to
    the behavior of his friends and enemies alike, immediately catching the
    fact that something big was bothering the normally upbeat faunus.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No. I-It’s nothing.” She sulked away. Before she could turn the corner and
    abandon him, Boreas observed that in addition to her strangely melancholy
    attitude, her <i>hooks</i> were being dragged on the floor, several feet
    behind her. Never before had she treated the weapons with such disrespect.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What’s the problem with her?” Nero wriggled around Zara, joining him.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “As much as it pains me to say, I don’t know. But I have a hunch. Say,
    you’re abundantly acute in antiques of the highest rarity. You wouldn’t
    happen to know where those <i>hooks</i> come from, would you?” Boreas
    checked his manuscripts. Nero simple nodded his head side to side. “All the
    more reason to investigate
    <b>
        myself.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Now, I know I’ve been here many times but I would just like to confirm one
    thing since, you know, I can’t <i>see.”</i> Beleth made sure his blindfold
was as tight as possible. “There’s one door into Terra Insanire-    <i>this</i> door. And the only way to open it is from either side is with
    the
    <i>
        Beryl Rhinestone?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Affirmative.” Lucifer brushed his hand across the gate. “Boreas is
    responsible, the mad genius. He found the key <i>and</i> the lock.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Is there any way out of here if we lose it?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The closest thing to an escape is the usual spot, actually. The ridge with
    that view of Beacon, where Troy sometimes likes to sneak up on us. Don’t
    try leaving though, it’s suicide. Affirmative, it’s the only breach in here
    that grants us a glimpse into the outside world, but the fall would be
    catastrophic. And the rock is too slick for even <i>Zara</i> to try
    scaling.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nice!” A wave of relief washed over Beleth, along with everyone else, for
    they’d reached the wholesome rays of the sun and the spoils of an arid
    landscape. “Back to the classic <i>Meridian.</i> Enchanting as always.”
    Over the numerous visits here, this area had been a focal point in many
    bouts, both of fighting skill and antics. The out-of-place quadrant of
    Terra Insanire was marred by wildlife and greenery, and was identified by
    the carving of the word <i>‘Meridian’ </i>on every tree. Troy was queried
    many times on this phenomenon. He always offered conflicting answers
    ranging from a fairly rambling discussion in regards to a pack of thieves
obsessed with a jewel named <i>‘Meridian,’ </i>to the claim that he    <b>himself</b> vandalized the oasis.

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How about you take that blindfold off and actually enjoy the surroundings
    for once? Even I take off my mask sometimes.” Lucifer suggested in earnest.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Mostly when he’s talking to me.” Selene giggled, cuddling her pet. “Isn’t
    that right, Merlin? <i>Awww! Good boy!”</i> She was soon joined by Lexy.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ahem!” Lucifer raised his voice. “First sparring match can commence-”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Beleth shouted over him. “The first sparring match can commence!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Okay, music-man. You may be one fighter down, which I’ll be happy to
    rectify later, but you talk a big game. You string a good game with the
    violin, too. Bring up your first challenger.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Zara! You better represent!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah. Whatever.” She brooded herself into position, across from Lucifer,
    who started and ended the fight in seconds.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Competition start.” He shot Zara instantly, causing her to join the hooks
    which remained on the ground. “Competition over. Next.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What!?” Beleth contested.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We’re going old-school this time. First one to take damage loses.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Zara moped on the ground. “Ugh. I really didn’t want to fight anyway.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Next!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No!” Alecto stood in front of Lucifer. “The last time we tried with those
    rules, you got an unfair victory over me, Beleth! Ditch the one-hit rule! I
    want a full, fair match against you! <i>C’mon!”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If you insist, Missy. Remember, I can control noise, and soundwaves. That
    includes <i>shutting you up.”</i> Beleth was equally excited to battle
    without such absurd rules made to be abused. He executed the standard
    position, violin resting on his shoulder and bow in hand.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah! Teach him a lesson, Alecto!” Selene stood up from Merlin to
    participate in the eager team sport. Lexy wasn’t one to be shown up though,
    so she too left the bunny.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Grr! Beleth, show her
    <i>
        the moves!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Sounds of lashing metal echoed throughout Terra Insanire, along with the
    chords of a violin. Alecto’s semblance was an event, considering how rare
    it was. In contrast, a large majority of Beleth’s attacks revolved around
    his hidden powers. Granted, there were times he couldn’t rely completely on
    the mystical currents generated with an aggressive symphony, or the calm
    melodic strings that produced a barricade. Those were the instances when
    his bow, which doubled as a scythe, came into play.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He was fighting <i>Alecto</i> though, the most prized duelist in Beacon
    Academy. It was foolish to believe he could match steel with her. In the
    end, this proved to be his downfall.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Gah!” He slipped up, getting launched across the woods through a stone
    wall. Light shone into the previously desolate cavern.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You alright?” Alecto followed him inside, meaning to help him to his feet
    despite his vast reserves of extra Aura. A crew of their companions
    followed suit. Any and all good intentions disappeared, however, once
    Beleth’s blindfold had fallen off in front of others for the first time.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “M-My blindfold!” He scrambled to strap it back over his face, but it was
    too late.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Beleth? You’re… You’re a Delphic?” Alecto was trying to comprehend what
    she’d saw. It wasn’t hard. Beleth was one of the <i>Grimm humanoids,</i>
    his secret thoroughly unveiled once the cloth that normally obscured his
    eyes, and by extension his entire face, was removed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Y-Yeah! But you can’t tell anyone! It’s supposed to be a secret! I’m
    serious, you can’t let anyone know! If word of me being Grimm escapes the
    walls of Team Blazer, I’ll be finished! Promise me you won’t tell anyone!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…” Alecto stood there without a word, simmering. Her fists tightened until
    her knuckles turned red. She was shaking.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Alecto. Don’t.” Lucifer reached for her shoulder, but he was too late to
    halt the explosion.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The knight lunged forward, attacking Beleth. She cared little for the
    repercussions, evidently, from the ferocious manner in which she locked her
    fingers around his neck and attempted to suffocate him, still rolling
    around the forest. Playtime was over.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You <i>loathsome</i> beast! You dishonor me!” Her insults could be heard
    as the now enemies tumbled away, making the foolish decision of brawling in
    a land of pitfalls. Fortunately, each had friends- the sort willing to
    diffuse this conflict. The question was whether or not they’d succeed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Wait. I’m sorry, but you have to stay behind.” Lucifer lagged behind
    everyone else, making sure <i>Selene</i> remained out of it.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “But I want to help!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No! You are not ready. Go back to the entrance of the Meridian, with
    Merlin. I will return.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Fine! Hmph!” She crossed both her arms and disappointingly watched her
    allies chase each other towards a new adventure.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How <i>dare</i> you play me for a fool!” Alecto resumed her speech of
    condemnation. “To think, after everything, you were a traitor all along! A
    <i>
        disgrace!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Why!? Just because I’m a <i>Delphic!?</i> You heartless <i>witch!”</i>
    Beleth ripped himself away from her, and began a heart-racing cacophony
    with full offensive capabilities. But it was pointless. Fueled by fury,
    Alecto weaved past every acute projectile and was back within arm’s reach
    in an instant.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “You are a beast, your mere existence treason! And I swore I would
        destroy all Delphics!”
    </i>
    She gave him a first-hand reminder of her strength, hitting him with the
    hilt of her blade whenever it wasn’t being used for stabbing or slashing.
    Their fight took both deep into Terra Insanire, in the presence of new
locations and breathtaking waterfalls. Unfortunately, they were too busy    <i>soiling</i> it to <i>appreciate</i> it. Rolling down a chute of rocks,
    Alecto wasn’t able to hold on, and she skid away into a foamy lake.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Enough! You know not what you fight for!” Beleth spoke too soon. Alecto
    stumbled out of the water, raised her blade, and aimed for his neck. He
    parried it with his violin, and the impact sent both of their killing tools
    careening away. That left only their hands, which were interlocked. Both
    looked each other in the eyes, pushing forward, hoping to subdue the other.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Blood lusted, Alecto’s irises were <i>smoking</i> red, her voice equally
    vapid.
    <i>
        “Even after all these years, I am <b>still</b> here to rid Remnant of
        your kind! And you were hiding under my nose this entire time! I won’t
stop- I won’t <b>ever</b> stop! For your betrayal, I’ll make sure you        <b>suffer</b> as I have!”
    </i>
    As she threatened, their clash tore a rift in the ground, and the mountains
    of Terra Insanire began to rumble. For when their weapons were flung aside,
    they cracked a loadbearing obelisk of rock, and now the wilderness had come
    crashing down. Neither were surprised to find their Aura decimated.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Disorientated, but stubborn, Alecto lifted herself back on her feet and
    surveyed the area. She was tackled down again. But it wasn’t <i>Beleth.</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Calm! Down!</i>
    This is getting out of hand!” Lucifer scolded, holding Alecto’s arms down.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Get off, now! Or else!” She growled. Eventually, he did retreat, thanks to
    <i>
        Beleth.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “She’s <i>mine!”</i> He wrapped his bow around Lucifer’s neck, trapping him
    in a head-lock. In-between his chokes, Beleth <i>pulled,</i> forcing him
    away from Alecto and onto the ground himself. Breaking free, his anger
    problems triumphed over all others, and Beleth would have learned this had
    a fourth party not intervened.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lexy walked in, twirled her fire wheel around, and <i>smacked</i> Lucifer
    halfway across the canyon. “Ha. <i>That’ll</i> teach him to stack the odds.
    Idiot. As for <i>you</i> Alecto, stand down. I don’t want to hurt you. Stop
    this madness.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b>“You!</b>
    You knew all along, didn’t you!?” Alecto didn’t heed the warning. “That
    makes you just as much a conspirator as he is! I won’t allow a defense of
    Delphics, not even from you! So, get out of my way, <i>now!”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re <i>adorable</i> when you’re angry.” It was a bitter compliment, one
    that drove Alecto to battle <i>Lexy</i> as well. The two soared past and
    tried fruitlessly to cut one another down. In Lexy’s case, she thought it
    best to do so with the crushing hoop everyone had come to know as her
    weapon, and she actually <i>had</i> Aura to spare.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    There were those unwilling to feud with their familiars, but distraught not
    to help the same. That’s where <i>Nadia</i> and her combatant came into
    play. The rogue had already dived headlong into the chaos. At least, that
    was the idea. But a wretched pair of fingers grabbed her by the hood and
    tugged her away.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Havoc is warranted!”</i>
    <b>Rade</b>
snickered. “Not for <b>me</b> though, I’m <i>far</i> too good for that! Are    <i>you?</i> Because if you don’t stop and control your fears, I
    <i>
        will.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Rade! You’re participating in this, too? You don’t need to add any more
    fuel to this fire. Please.” Nadia was as elusive in avoiding conflict as
    she was <i>during</i> conflict.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ha! <i>Groveling,</i> Nadia? Is that how you cope when it all comes
crashing down? Interesting strategy, it is surely the result of    <i>years</i> and <i>years</i> of- <i>Gah!”</i> He began sporadically
    scraping his quill pen across the Fear Index. What started as barely
    legible devolved further once he smeared the pen across the page, Nadia
    emerging from behind and twisting him around onto his back. She had zero
    desire to fight him, and used this opportunity to flee in hopes of
    diffusing the skirmish between Alecto and Beleth before things became truly
profane. Rade, likewise, was a tricky rascal with a surprising knack for    <i>speed</i> who would not be denied.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He misinterpreted her ambition, believing she was determined not to
    disperse everyone, but <i>join</i> everyone. That was the reasoning behind
    his resolve to contest her. Both had ruthless instruments to stab,
    puncture, and even inject <i>venom</i> in Nadia’s case. It was evident,
    despite this, that both were holding back. Neither had any plans to harm
    the other. If only the same applied to Beleth and Alecto.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “May I ask a question?” Zara walked onto the scene and tripped them both
    with her hooks. “Just one <i>bloody</i> question. Why are you two fighting
    when our friends are <i>killing</i> each other?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What are you doing, little ram!? <i>I’m</i> keeping things fair and
balanced, by excluding both myself and <i>‘Lady’</i> Flora    <i>- love the name, by the way-</i> <b>out</b> of this charade.” Rade
    coughed out his explanation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nadia glossed over his compliment. “But why? If you don’t want to fight,
    then we’re after the same thing. Let’s get in there and talk some sense
    into them!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Or <i>knock</i> some sense, as the case may be.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Zara had seen firsthand the drive of Alecto, and the persistence of Beleth.
    She received another reminder when the two slammed out into the open. The
    grotto from which they’d come had been obliterated, and now they were
    shaping up to desecrate more of the Meridian. “That’ll be easier said than
    done. We’re not talking to <i>anyone</i> right now. The best thing now is
    to <i>isolate</i> them, so everyone can calm down. But nobody here has the
    power to do that. I can’t. Nadia, you’re the best when it comes to a single
    target but I don’t mean offense when I say your semblance won’t help here.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “None taken.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Really?” Rade piped up. “Then I’m definitely out of the picture. So what
    do we do? If only we could summon a giant monster, and carry them apart…”
    Rade thought to himself in silence, until the clicking of heels alerted
    him, Nadia, and Zara to the missing link.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “M-Maybe I could do something? I know Lucifer wanted me to stay out of it,
    but I can help! I <i>know</i> I can!” Selene said. There was a pause as
    everyone in this mini alliance hell-bent on unity had the same idea.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Grr! I’ve never liked you!” Alecto screamed in Lexy’s face, frustrated
    with the Flame Bearers insistence on keeping her away from Beleth. “You
    precious, stuck up, prissy diva! Get <i>away</i> from me!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lexy payed no attention to words, desperate to stop Alecto. The cost could
    be paid later. She might have managed it, if Lucifer hadn’t recovered in
    time to step into the fray. Alecto had resigned to keep fighting even
    outnumbered, and <i>now</i> she had backup. Enough <i>peace.</i> Lucifer,
after the joy of being shattered through half the forest, found    <i>getting even</i> was top priority.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“You’ll pay for that!”</i>
    He snarled, wrapping the chain of her wheel around his arm and using his
    superior strength to flail her around and grant the same treatment he
    received. Once the smoke cleared, Team <i>Lance’s</i> second in command and
    their leader stood across <i>Blazer’s</i> equivalent.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re really going to take her side, Lucifer?” Beleth asked. “After what
    she’s said and done? She tried to kill me several times in the past few
    minutes alone. I know she may have filled your head with lies concerning
    Delphics, but I know you can’t be <i>that</i> easily manipulated.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I may not <i>fully</i> agree with her on this one. But your kind assistant
    just launched me through a mountain.” He needn’t explore the issue further.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I only did that because you were about to attack my best friend.” Lexy
    protested.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“He</i>
    got the first strike.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Then I’m <b>taking</b> the last!”</i>
    Alecto lined up her sword and geared up for a leaping thrust.
    Instinctively, the other three champs held their equipment forward.
    Meaningless, their efforts were. A mauve pylon of ghastly presentation
    opened up, and from it <i>Royal Necrocyst</i> entered Remnant. The entity
put full focus on Lucifer and Alecto, swiping them up and    <i>carrying them</i> away. In terms of distracting Team <i>Blazer</i>,
    someone with a good arm chucked <b>Merlin</b> at them. <i>He</i> had been
    instructed to be as <i>annoying</i> as possible by covering their eyes.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ah! What is this? <i>Necrocyst!</i> Let me go!” Alecto struggled while
    Royal glided far across Terra Insanire. It couldn’t go too high or far, but
    far enough to thoroughly separate these disputants.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer lamented his failure to talk down Selene. <i>“Damn it!</i> We’ve
taught her how to use her semblance, and now she can use it against    <i>us!</i> I told her not to involve herself with this. How many countless
enemies I’ve fought, and opponents I’ve seen broken before me, and    <i>she</i> dives in against my orders. It would almost admirable, if it
    wasn’t so
    <i>
        dangerous.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Royal Necrosis let them go and retreated back to the void. Alecto tumbled
    across the damp floor of a stone hut, and kicked over a number of balanced
    rock piles to show her displeasure. “If only she listened! Now she’s
    disbanded everyone, probably her intention. She should stick to dancing and
    singing, <i>not</i> warfare! That’s your thing.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Affirmative, but if that was her goal, I partially agree with her. Why    <i>did</i> you attack Beleth?” He asked. From a distance, behind
    stalactites, the four masterminds watched.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Maybe you should go out there, Selene. It would be better if the teams
    were together.” Zara suggested.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Um, okay… Nadia, do you want to come with?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Not exactly. I’ll be there, just invisible. I-I hate keeping secrets, but
    it must be this way. <i>Someone</i> has to keep watch and act as the
    failsafe in case you can’t change their minds.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well, it doesn’t seem like <i>Lucifer</i> needs much changing. You two
    will return to Team Blazer? Can you keep an eye out for Merlin, too?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Zara nodded while Rade articulated an actual response. “Yesiree! Although,
    I’m fond of the cloak n’ dagger swagger. I wouldn’t mind trying it myself,
    as long as you don’t mind me tramping your style, Nadia.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Zara cut in. “I actually like that idea. We’ll make sure Beleth is safe,
    even if it requires treachery from the shadows. Somehow, I think it will.
    Just take the <i>Rhinestone</i>, leave Terra Insanire, and fix this. Then
    come back for us. It shouldn’t take long. It <i>better</i> not take long.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nadia tiptoed out of sight and disappeared for good. Selene did the
    opposite, nervously approaching Lucifer and Alecto. “Oh, um guys? I hope
    you’re not mad at me…”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto and Lucifer looked at each other, with him taking the reins. “I
    wanted to spare you for this fight. But, I can see, you’re determined. I
    suppose I shouldn’t be surprised, you probably got it from <i>me.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So you’re not mad?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m not. Not yet, at least. What about you?” He faced Alecto.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Mad?</i>
    Yes, I’m <i>mad.</i> The Delphic escaped. Just like Nobody. Unbelievable.
    They’re all the same.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Quit your complaining. Yes, <i>nobody</i> likes <i>Nobody.</i> But Beleth
    is different. We’ve known him since we arrived in Beacon, and he hasn’t
    done anything to make me question his allegiance. We have a bigger problem.
    <i>
        The Beryl Rhinestone is gone.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“What!?”</i>
    Alecto was shaking her head at his defense of Beleth, but was now alarmed
    at hearing such dire news. “Why is it gone? What happened?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “When I was whacked by that insipid wheel, I lost it. The record shows that
    the stone will wander, and do whatever it wants. Who knows how far it’s
    travelled in this time. It’s all falling apart.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Does that mean we’re trapped until someone finds it?” Selene shuddered.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Affirmative.
    <i>
        Team Lance and Team Blazer are stuck here until the Rhinestone is
        found.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “There must be another way. That door holds a striking resemblance to one
    Nomad opened back in Summit’s Blight. But then again, he had the Rhinestone
    at the time…”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Further confirmation then that this valley is locked for the time being.
    No way in, and no way out. Finding the stone should be the most important
    task for everyone.”
    <p>
    </p>

    Alecto dismissed his game plan. “Suit yourself. I’m just wasting time
    standing around here.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Where are you going?” Lucifer groaned.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hunting.” She hopped down a sheer rockslide, out of view.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “She’s hunting for food, right?” Selene said.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…I just hope she’s not hunting <i>Grimm.</i> Regardless, it seems finding
    the key out of here falls to us. As usual, I must do everything myself. And
    worst yet, I cannot call anyone. The scroll is worthless. Not even a rocket
    propelled locker would receive a signal, and even if it did, it can’t get
    through these mountainous walls. If only we had one already, we could
    easily launch someone from Troy’s shop in the Meridian. Pointless. It’s all
    pointless.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hmm. Wait. How did Rade get here this morning?” An interesting conundrum
    hit Selene.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He used the Rhinestone, obviously.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “But <i>Boreas</i> had the Rhinestone. And then he gave it to us, and
    that’s how <i>we</i> ended up here. If Rade managed to make it in on his
    own, there must be a way out!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer thought for a moment, congratulated Selene on her quick wit, and
    then switched strategies. “I haven’t even seen Rade yet. Or Troy for that
    matter. They must know something we don’t. If you see either, direct them
    to me. Understood?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Okay.” Selene lied. She remembered how Nadia, Rade, and Zara planned to
    spy in order to keep from furthering the new divide between their teams.
    They were in <i>complete</i> damage control mode, and would enact an
    appropriate procedure with that in mind.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Within Vale, another subset of heroes also had their hands full with
stalking Delphics. Nobody had made quite a name for himself, and now the    <i>Warden</i> of Augustus Correctional had no choice but to step in. Deep
    inside the Forever Fall forest, he was investigating the village where the
    Grimm was last seen by Team Lance. And with him, Ella and Boreas tailed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I just want to be clear. <i>This</i> is where the Delphic was? This empty
    village? And it was Nobody. The <i>same</i> Nobody who conspired against me
    with Dimitri?” Augusts squinted at his surroundings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Boreas laid out all the facts. “Exactly. I never saw the fight myself, I
    only ended it. Nobody’s reaction to the Rhinestone is <i>concerning,</i> to
    say the least. He identified it instantly, then threw in the towel. There’s
a good possibility he could have ended everyone here, but he    <i>flew away,</i> in fact.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Did he grow wings?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He called a Griffon. His sword was the method of summoning. That blasted
    sound is unforgettable, <i>despite</i> my best efforts.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Augustus checked most of the homes, then analyzed the ground for
    footprints. Selene’s heels were easily identified. Lucifer’s boots,
    Alecto’s metal soles, and Nadia’s ritualistic slippers were equally
    distinct. Then there were two <i>massive</i> holes left by Boreas and Nero.
    Even the paws of Merlin couldn’t be missed. That left <i>two</i>
    unidentified shoe grooves. One of them belonged to Nobody, the other a sure
    mystery.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
Augustus adjusted his glasses and floated off the floor. “So he    <i>‘cleansed’ </i>this village, you say? Then where are all the bodies?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Maybe he threw them down the cliff? No, he couldn’t have <i>possibly</i>
    tried it. Team Lance was on him the moment smoke filled the skies.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Augustus looked for any sign of burnt buildings or rubble. “Every
    house is intact, though. Where was this fire? Was it this?” With his sword,
    he collapsed a charred pile of logs that, by his calculations, acted as a
    pyre a few days prior.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It would seem. That bonfire was smoldering by the time I entered the
    scene.” Boreas scoured the recesses of his memory to recall every last
    detail, no matter how mundane it seemed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “And it’s expertly constructed, without the use of bodies as kindle.”
    Augustus put the pieces together. “No one was <i>ever</i> here before he
    arrived. The menace must’ve set up this fire to get someone’s attention. I
    guess it worked, but did he find who he was looking for? <i>Who</i> was he
    looking for?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The only one who would’ve come here at the sign of an invasion is a
    Huntsman or Huntress. Or us.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Right you are!”</i>
    Someone’s voice exploded forth, making everyone flinch. The perplexing last
    set of footprints belonged to this tall man, wearing a cloak that exposed
    <i>
        nothing.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Identify yourself.” Augustus turned to see the unnerving figure tread out
    of the scree of a crumpled lodge into the middle of town. Ella hid behind
    Boreas, whose own confidence faltered.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I came here same as you, to investigate Nobody and the recent attacks on
    Forever Fall. But things have gone quiet around here. Now you’re the
    loudest threat in Forever Fall. Save for myself, of course. I should tell
    you all about the first time I ventured out here as a wee lad! But another
    time.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…” Augustus wasn’t sure how to respond. He could have sworn he recognized
    the man’s inflection, as gruff as it was. “That’s certainly intriguing. But
    I asked who you are, not why you’re here. Honestly, I’d like to know both.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Why, you know who I am! You too, Mister Zale!” The stranger removed his
hook and revealed himself to be none other than    <i>Professor Stamatios. </i>“Aha! I leave for a few weeks, and you all
    forget about me? That’ll be detention. Haha!”
    <i>
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Professor!” Boreas emitted a sound of pure relief. “Thank goodness it’s
    you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Augustus let his shoulders down as well. “Finally, a break. Anytime someone
    shows up outside of Vale with flowing robes, it’s never good. Guess you’re
    always the exception. Great to see you, Stam.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“And I you! But now is not the time to rejoice. That can wait for the    <i>dance.</i> I trust Professor Penelope has been doing an exceptional job
    in my wake, Mister Zale? Her work in my absence was one of the reasons I
    recruited her.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “She’s an excellent teacher, Professor. Smart of you to consider her as a
    substitute, but if you don’t mind my asking, what are you doing here, and
    what are you
    <i>
        wearing?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Stam strutted forward and laid a hand on Augustus’s shoulder. “I’m hot on
    the case to find that <i>Nobody.</i> He was responsible for the surplus of
    Grimm attacks, and now he’s gone and left. The trail’s gone cold… As for
    this outfit, these are my old garments from ages ago. A Huntsman must have
    a uniform from his early, more adventurous days buried in his wardrobe for
    the times he isn’t standing guard at crosswalks.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
Augustus summed up the situation. “So everyone’s looking for <i>Nobody. </i>And <i>Nobody’s</i> looking for <i>somebody.</i> And    <i>somebody</i>’s gone <i>somewhere,</i> where <i>Nobody</i> isn’t<i>.</i>
    The question is, <i>who</i> is somebody, and <i>where</i> is Nobody?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-I’m confused.” Ella spoke for everyone.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Stam put the investigation back on track. “The next best thing is to track
    him. You say he flew? Then he left no trace. My recommendation is to spread
    out, maximize our presence, and look for anything. The tiniest detail can
    mean something. Take for example <i>this.”</i> He pointed a statue with
    various fierce claw marks, inflicted with four nails. “It was a grimm who
    decimated this village, but not Nobody. Tell me this, Mister Zale. What
    grimm is capable of this sort of damage?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Hm. Plenty of them have claws, but I know of none capable of stabbing    <i>this</i> far. This statue is <i>ruined.</i> Not to mention, Grimm aren’t
    prone to marking their territory. Must’ve been quite the old specimen.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Was it <i>this?”</i> Augustus glided out of a decrepit cabin, a flimsy
    notepad in his hand. It was opened to a sketch, likely constructed by a
    child. If it was accurate, and depicted the Grimm responsible, then the
    village’s executioner was a hellish humanoid creature, with fingers nearly
    triple the normal length. And based off of the other drawings transcribed,
    the nightmare was missing its lower half, and could <i>fly.</i> “Sure is a
    looker. Glad I’m not the only one missing legs.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Why is that, anyway? Heard it’s a byproduct of your semblance. So rather,
    what <i>is</i> your semblance?” Boreas took comfort in his own writings,
    and began updating his bestiary with information gathered on the gangly
    Grimm.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Few are permitted to know. That’s <i>the Administrator’s</i> protocol.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Who’s the <i>Administrator?”</i> Boreas continued the line of questioning.
    Back and forth they went, with Stam tending to nearby clues. That left
    Ella, who tried to do the same, but only separated herself from her more
prepared allies. And with her, a fifth unknown student had been watching,    <i>waiting.</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ella! Don’t run!” Terrance cornered her within one of the more luxurious
    mansions. She fell back, too petrified to speak. “There’s nothing to be
scared of! Don’t you remember me? Or anything from the past life? That damn    <i>‘Oathkeeper’</i> couldn’t have really taken away everything, could he?
    What is your last name?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-I don’t know! Just leave me alone!” Although she could never explain it
    in words, his mere visage and physical form brought about immense dread and
    doubt. “I don’t know who you are, all I know is I’m supposed to stay away
    from you!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yet <i>I</i> know who <i>you</i> are. Explain that.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Th-Then prove it! Who am I? <i>You</i> tell me my last name.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Terrance seemed deeply conflicted, the dew of tears settling on his eyes.
“I-I can’t. If I do, there’s a chance you’ll remember the… No, it’s    <i>impossible!</i> I’m sorry. I have to do this.” He shuffled closer, his
    steps fussy, the nodes on his coat beginning to discharge
    <i>
        electricity.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Mister Sirius!” Professor Stam slammed his way through the front door, the
    volume of his shouting more terrifying than any surprise entry.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What!? Professor?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Aha! Bet you didn’t expect to see me here did you? And <b>you!”</b> He
    knelt down to observe Ella closely, having never encountered the
    holographic wanderer before. After his deduction, he hoisted her onto her
feet. “Hmm… <i>Blue skin, transparent, horns...</i> You must be Miss    <b>Ella!</b> I’ve heard a lot about you from your friend Miss Flora! It’s a
    pleasure to meet you in person.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Y-You know Nadia?” She hid behind him to get away from Terrance.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “But of course! She’s one of my students, same as this capable young
    trooper!” He gestured towards Terrance. “You’re <i>always</i> welcome in
    Beacon Academy. Don’t forget! Who am I joking, if Miss <i>Flora’s</i>
    recruited you, you must be sharp as a razor. Probably have the memory of an
    elephant, no?
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>

    “Um, actually, Professor.” Terrance, in a display reminiscent of the last
    time his plan was interrupted, mimicked ignorance. He and Ella had an
    understanding that neither were to reveal their knowledge to others. Though
    in Ella’s case, due to her limited recollection, there wasn’t much to
    spoil. “She has a memory problem. She can’t remember much at all, no matter
    what <i>I</i> or really anyone does.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>

    “Then that’s no good! You know, back in the old days, when young lads
couldn’t quite recall that Grimm tip, we used to give them a crack on the    <i>noggin!</i> Works every time. Although, there might have been one or two
    times it just furthered the holes in their memory. I can’t really
    remember.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Save the cracking for Nobody.” Augustus and Boreas joined them. “I’ll be
    sure to give him a stern punishment myself when I find him, before turning
    him into the Administrator of course. But we’ve looked all over, there’s
    nothing left here. He’s disappeared.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    An interesting thought hit Boreas. “I might have an idea of where he’s
    gone, actually. His fixation with the Beryl Rhinestone was not forgotten,
    and it was the last thing he commented upon before sparing us, and leaving.
    If he knows what the Rhinestone is, and has left because of it, perhaps
    he’s gone to its origin.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Where might that be?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Summit’s Blight.”</i>
    Boreas looked past the dwindling sun in the direction of warping clouds
    responsible for endless rainstorms. The thunder could barely be felt, even
    if the lightning was easily spotted- splitting rifts of gorgeous light in
    an otherwise dreary and inhospitable wasteland.

    “Aha! The key player fled there, did he? Then I have some good news, ladies
    and gentlemen!” Stam waited at the bridge leading out of the ghost town,
    the backside of his cape swooping aside with the eager gusts. “We’re taking
    another field trip back to where it all began!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Augustus wasn’t as hopeful. “I’d rather drown than go into that vehemently
    perilous hellhole. And if I do, that’s likely what’ll happen. Nomad left,
    and he took his mental map with him. We haven’t the resources to chase
    through <i>there.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If I may cut in, Augustus.” Boreas cleared his throat. “Professor Stam has
been there many times. I don’t think it’ll be a problem as long as we take    <i>him.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He’s right.” Stam turned, the beginnings of a smile forming along his
    lips.
