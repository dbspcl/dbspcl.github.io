    The shattered moon did a fine job of illuminating Vale’s roads, although
    the streetlamps were adequate enough. Night had fallen upon the kingdom,
    dwindling the number of active civilians. Their <i>guardians</i> were never
    absent, though.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Pretty funny how we’re the first to get these textbooks, you know?” Zara
    smirked, although Lucifer didn’t see anything <i>funny</i> about it, all
    things considered. “I wish they were available earlier, though. Maybe then
    we wouldn’t be here this late just to skip tomorrow’s mob.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I have my team to blame for that, and I’m guessing you have yours. My
    memories fail me- what are they called? They’re not <i>all</i> faunus,
    right?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Aha, no. Only me. We’re Team <i>Blazer.”</i> She admitted. “You should
meet them sometime. Team Lance might be one of the more    <i>unconventional</i> teams, but in that area I think they might have you
    beat. Half of them forced me to come here, and I don’t even <i>know</i>
    where the last one is. You?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nadia had personal business. The others wanted some extra sleep, so I
    offered.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re not tired?” Zara yawned.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Negative.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Guess that means we’re <i>both</i> nocturnal, huh?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You don’t know the half of it.” They retrieved the textbooks from Beacon’s
    library then sat down at one of the exterior tables to survey the
    inventory.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I love how we get the bundle for free as long as we have our library
    cards. This <i>‘Textbook Set Number One’</i> better have everything though,
    otherwise it’ll sour the cake.” Zara sorted through her four sets. “Wait a
    second, this batch is missing one. Do you have all yours?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’ve got everything.” Lucifer took a seat.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ugh. Guess I have to go complain, now.” She marched away with her bags.
    Lucifer sighed, checking his scroll.
    <i>
        Nothing. Good.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He knew somebody was approaching him- their squishy footsteps, while quiet
    to anyone else, met his ears. A glance over showcased something more
horrifying than anything he’d encountered since his time in Beacon began,    <i>period.</i> The freak was malnourished but tall, sporting the clothes of
    a dummy, and holding a wide smile that would have seemed more appropriate
    on a <i>pumpkin.</i> Lucifer had seen him a few times in Stam’s class, but
    opted to ignore the antics, and spare himself the madness.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“You seem like an odd little fellow!” </i>
The apparition noted Lucifer’s short-lived but potent reputation.    <i>“How could anyone think you’re scarier than <b>me?”</b></i>
    <b>
        <p>
        </p>
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’ve got the wrong guy. Move on.” He grunted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“No, no, no! You’re in my classes, and with such mystery clouding you,    <i>I</i> wanted the privilege of breaking the ice! What’s your name?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hmph.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “<i>’Hmph?’</i> Well that’s a scary name! Mine is Rade!” The degenerate
    conjured up a thick book with strange symbols on it. The withered pages
    were swung to a blank sheet without command. Rade scribbled in the fake
    name with a quill pen. “And just for my own curiosity, for such a foe
    surrounded by fear, you must have a few of your own! What <i>are</i> you
    afraid of?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Conversation. Now <i>leave.”</i> Lucifer rolled his eyes.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Tsk, tsk, tsk! I don’t think that’s right.” Rade shook his head and tapped
    on the page in an exaggerated display. “Try, try again!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Leave, leave</i>
    again.” Lucifer’s patience wasn’t very plentiful.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If you insist.” The book warped out of existence and Rade skipped into the
    shadow. Lucifer watched his silhouette fade, then looked forward. Rade was
    sitting in the chair opposite to his.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How did you-“
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ooh! Is that a journal begging for your greatest fears, or are you just
    happy to see me?” Rade cackled.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer looked down, the world atlas-sized book staring him in the eye.
    Lucifer grabbed the pen and finally cracked, writing down <i>an</i> answer.
    He slid the book back.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>‘Go away.’</i>
    Was written next to
    <i>
        ‘Hmph.’
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Fiddle-sticks! Now I can’t use this page!” Rade ripped it out and
    slithered next to the unwilling applicant. “You’re not a very happy camper,
    are you? Your mask must have a few screws loose!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Listen to me!” Lucifer wrenched Rade face-to-face by the noose around his
    shriveled neck. “You have nothing to gain by staying here, and plenty to
    lose! I welcome it!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hohoo! Don’t be so <i>daft!”</i> The creep breathed into Lucifer’s
    metallic face, spouting green fog forth. He shuffled back a few feet,
seemingly stunned. Rade took the opportunity to pull out his    <i>pitchfork.</i> Having thrown in the towel and gone forward with full
    offensive intent, he whacked his enemy with it, ignoring or forgetting the
    prongs.
    <i>
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Dargh!”</i>
    Lucifer swung forward towards what he perceived to be the fork’s source,
    but met nothing. Rade had already swooped around, and struck him again. The
    charade continued for a couple more hits until Lucifer was able to dodge
    around Rade’s disorienting dance and get ahold of him. One brutal punch did
    a number on the fear-inducing maniac, but there was more treachery to come.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A jack-in-the-box flew from a staggered Rade onto the floor and opened
    without even playing the tune fit for such a device. A caricature of its
    owner bobbed forth, somehow <i>stunning</i> Lucifer. Considering his
    expertise and military-tech, a flashbang wouldn’t have been effective in
    the slightest. Against all odds <i>this</i> was.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Rade whipped Lucifer upside the head with his armament and proceeded forth
    with a series of nimble kicks. Lucifer could take a little more than a
    beating though, and despite some considerate blows to his Aura, he was
    undeterred.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He grabbed Rade by his leg and chucked him straight into the ground.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ack! That… caused <i>pain!”</i> Rade convulsed in all directions. It was
    hard to tell if he was really in trouble, or if he was putting on a show.
    Lucifer didn’t care, he brought the pitchfork down around Rade’s neck,
    alongside his noose. It didn’t cause any real damage, the pikes missing,
    thought it <i>did</i> lock him in place.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Willing to play nice, now?” Lucifer threatened. Rade’s chortles never
    left, they only grew more plentiful. He wasn’t even close to finished,
    already having a plan to turn the tides. But the fight was diffused before
    he could take the chance.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What are you doing!?” Zara dropped her textbooks.
    <i>
        “L-Lucifer! Stop!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Stay back, Zara! This scoundrel was at my throat!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No! He attacked first!” Rade said.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Stop! Get off him! That’s my <i>teammate!”</i> Zara bolted over. She took
    charge of the pitchfork and tugged it out of the ground.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Teammate!? <i>What?”</i> He was speechless.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Eck!” Rade groaned, hopping up and stretching.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Rade, are you okay?” Zara patted him on the shoulder. “What are you doing
    here? If you were going to show up anyway, you could have helped me with
    the books! No doubt, you’re at least partially to blame for this.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “M-My apologies. I had no idea.” The words of regret seemed foreign coming
    out of Lucifer’s mouth.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Sorry? For what? I was having <i>fun!</i> The thrill of battle is almost
    as great as the thrill of a <i>scare!”</i> Rade did a spastic jig.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So we’re on good terms?” Lucifer crossed his arms.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I hold no grudges! At the very worst, I would’ve had to use my semblance!
    But only <b>one</b> has ever <i>forced</i> me- and you ain’t <i>him.”</i>
    Rade had the sense not to ask about fears, at least for now. “Sometime I
    ought to get a fair <i>rematch,</i> though! I’m looking forward to it!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “In your dreams.” Lucifer began a slow jog back to Beacon Academy’s dorm
    rooms, the textbooks in hand.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No dreams! Only nightmares!” Rade looked around and crept deep into the
    night’s shade. Even if Lucifer hadn’t given in regarding his secrets, there
    were plenty of <i>other</i> students not as adamant to hold their cards so
    close to their chest. “Catch you later!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You too. Try to be back before midnight.” Zara picked up her own bags and
    ran to catch up with Lucifer. Their sparse conversation was mundane,
    especially in the wake of the recent mishaps. Getting back to their rooms
    was number one priority, as the recent incident reminded them of Vale’s
    tendency to bring about a bump in the night. Rade wasn’t even the worst of
    it. Nadia was about to learn <i>that</i> first hand.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The edge of Vale was mostly devoid of any light save for the occasional
    lantern. After seeing this fact, Nadia had an idea that was ultimately
    proven correct. As long as night was upon her, the sky bordering the ocean
    would deepen further into darkness and show even more stars than usual.
    Their luminescence was generously sprinkled throughout, creating a deluge
    of beauty few would appreciate.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Huntress-trainee leaned on the fence of the pier, smiling in
    contentment, quick to nearly meditate at the view. She was displeased to
hear a blemish on the wave’s echo, the horn of a ship docking.    <i>“A cruise ship?” </i>she thought. At this late hour, a luxurious yacht
    was most unexpected. Perhaps they were simply off schedule. A shadow left
    the exit-gates alone, and moseyed down the wooden dock.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Missy?</i>
    Surely a lass such as yourself would be better suited <i>indoors</i> at
    this late hour, no?” The man chuckled, balancing against the plank-barrier
    and striking conversation. He was dressed as the ideal tourist, all the way
    down to his tropical shirt and shorts.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I… Uh, I’m from Beacon Academy. I can handle myself.” She considered the
    interloper harmless, but was unused to small talk with absolute strangers.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s none other than the combat school, <i>am I right?</i> My apologies,
    I’m new to Vale.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No, that’s right!” Nadia nodded. “Welcome to our kingdom. Y-You’ll love it
    here. It’s, um, not like the others.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“I’m counting on it.</i>
    The name’s Dimitri.” His grin was unreasonably wide, and his hollow eyes
    didn’t help. But if Nadia had judged people on appearance alone, her
    teammates wouldn’t have stood a chance.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nadia.” She beamed back.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“I was wondering, <i>Nadia,</i> if you could do me the    <i>teeny-tiniest little</i> favor!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “O-Okay… What is it?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Could you catch a snapshot of me in front of the waves?” Dimitri unwrapped
    his camera from around his neck and held it forward.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m sorry if I mess it up.” His task required her to take several steps
    back. He leaned both arms on the railing and smiled at the lens. After the
    job was done, she handed it back to him. “Is that good?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I couldn’t ask for anything more. <i>Till next time!”</i> He pat her on
    the back, enjoying how well framed the shot was, before drifting away
    towards the promise land. Nadia bowed to resume her star-watching session.
    His crooning could be heard even as he approached the wharf’s gate.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Stop right there!” One of two cops charged into the scene to apprehend the
    sightseer. “You are under arrest! Get down, now!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Gentlemen, you’ve got the wrong guy! I’m just out on vacation!” Dimitri
    spat out an earnest attempt at reasoning, pointing at his camera as if it
    was somehow proof.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Silence! You thought you could get away just by leaving Mistral?” One of
    them approached with handcuffs at the ready.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You got me, I surrender!” He held both his hands up. One of the policemen
    held a baton at the ready, the other proceeded to pull his arms down. They
    could only get one cuff locked onto his wrist before resistance arrived.
His voice, when shouting, had a frighteningly effective pierce to it.    <i>“Not a chance! You’re <b>laid off!”</b> </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Dimitri force his elbow into them both, meaning to take full advantage of
    the stupor that followed. A slick attack that more resembled a karate
    technique threw the lawman overhead, into the ocean below. With half his
    enemies already gone, Dimitri was sitting pretty. The other cop was dealt
    with as efficiently as the first, only instead of the sea he found resolve
    further down the docks.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “I hope your kind come back, lest we find solace in the peace of a
        great <b>holiday!”</b>
    </i>
    Dimitri summoned an <i>extendable crowbar</i> and prepared to strike true.
    Someone <i>unseen</i> halted his swing.
    <i>
        “What!?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nadia needn’t say anything, her intentions more than clear. She glared up
    at him with fierce eyes, blocking his swing with her needles.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“A hero? Oho, you’re going to be <b>spectacular.”</b></i>
    His lips stretched ear to ear.
    <i>
        “I think I found myself a new apprentice! Here’s hoping you fare better
        than the last!”
    </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The fight began as any would, a game of back and forth that ended in a tie.
    Nadia was swift, faster than most, but her edge was lost in a one on one
    engagement. Dimitri had no shortage of tricks nor practice, using the
    crowbar like a sword when convenient or a club when needed. Although
    Nadia’s agility allowed her to get a few shots in, there wasn’t enough time
    to inject venom, and Dimitri’s Aura seemed endless.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Take <i>that!”</i> Dimitri blindsided her with a metal right hook, then
    followed up with a barrage of hits that threw Nadia off balance.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ah!” She gasped, turning invisible to evade his wrath. While Dimitri loved
    his one-liners and wit, she put full focus on the fight. It rewarded her
    well. Finally, she snuck a few rakes in, but her opposition was stronger
    than the average Grimm. More would be needed to subdue him.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“You’ve got me <b>fired</b> up!” </i>
    A twirl of steel followed the laugh, blocking further incursions. Their
    choreography was admirable, even more so how Dimitri could keep up with
    Nadia despite her insistence to go invisible after every stalemate.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Eventually Dimitri’s own <i>apparel</i> stood in the way. The floor was
    smooth from the water’s outbreak, and his fur slippers could find no pity
    on the slippery bridge. A number of planks split under his weight. Amidst a
    stroke of pure genius, or perhaps mindless idiocy, Dimitri used one to
    shield himself. The four pins impaled the wood, sticking through to the
    other side.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Spicy!” Dimitri twisted the makeshift talisman and pulled, forcing Nadia
    over him onto <i>her</i> back. The two sprinted to their feet and clashed
    with their chosen weapons.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Enough of this!”</i>
    Nadia huffed out, making a potentially foolish move. She broke the staring
    contest and attempted a calculated stab with her gauntlet. This was a
    particular favorite of hers. It had brought an uneasy death to many foes
    before.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All her speed and finesse did nothing. Dimitri had her beat with a ruthless
    parry. She was both physically and mentally dazed at his ensuing onslaught.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The criminal ended the fight by spinning his crowbar forth and latching the
    hooked portion onto Nadia’s shoulder, whirling her onto her back. She had
    Aura to spare, but Dimitri wasn’t having it. His slipper locked Nadia’s
    equipped arm to the ground.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“G-Get off! How dare you!”</i>
    She struggled to get free with her other hand.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Vale’s new inhabitant considered saying something but decided against it
    when several floodlights targeted him. He was once again intercepted by the
    police, only there were far more this time.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Hands up! Do not move! You are under arrest by command of    <i>Augustus Correctional Facility!”</i> A bullhead’s loudspeaker shouted
    him down. Several cops set their reticles on him.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Correctional!? Hohoo, they don’t know what they’re in for!” </i>
    Dimitri crouched down and laughed in Nadia’s face.
    <i>
        “I came here after my last student couldn’t take the heat. And now, for
        my troubles, I’ve run right into <b>you!</b> The perfect replacement.
        You’re <b>mine,</b> do you hear me? Good. Stay in touch!”
    </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He did as commanded, throwing in the towel. His captors advanced with care
    to avoid the last failure that had befallen the police force. For all the
    tension building, it was almost disappointing to see Dimitri <i>let</i>
    them put the chains on this time. The only defiance displayed was verbal.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Are you alright?” One of the cops gave Nadia a hand.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-I guess... He’s dangerous, you know.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We <i>know.</i> The guy’s been wanted in both Mistral <i>and</i> Vacuo.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That bad, huh? I… I should probably go with you, then.” She craned her
    neck around, recovering from the ordeal. As long as her Aura wasn’t
    depleted, she was willing do her duty.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If you insist. Hey, we could use a testimony, actually. Ever been to
    <i>
        Augustus Correctional?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, um… I can’t say that I have. Sorry. I just moved her recently. I hope
    it’s nicer than it sounds.” Nadia simpered.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “As long as you’re on our side, I’d say it is.” The police ensured her. She
    followed the crew into the nearest squad car and drove off towards the so
    called Augustus Correctional Facility. She couldn’t have possibly known she
    was headed to one of the most expansive prisons Sanus had to offer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The treatment center was home to a varied army of scum Remnant had spawned,
    but its titular <b>owner</b> was nowhere to be found. <i>Augustus</i>
    probably could have been a great ally in detaining Dimitri, if he wasn’t
    occupied on the other side of town with personal affairs.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    It seemed this particular segment of Vale was witness to a light rainstorm.
    Thus leaks of water sifting into the alleyways of the suburbs. It wouldn’t
be long before such a phenomenon took over the entire kingdom.    <i>The man</i> didn’t mind.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Warden! You there?” The distorted cries of his subordinates crawled out of
    his coat, courtesy of the walkie talkie shoved inside.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m here.” Augustus’s voice was shrill but kind.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We just caught word, a commotion at the western dock’s been stopped. The
    suspect was apprehended.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “You found a Delphic!?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “N-No. It’s Dimitri. We’ve got him.” The nameless, aimless deputy
    clarified.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’ll be there soon.” There was further work to be done. Grimm attacks were
    growing ever more common in the region of Vale bordering Forever Fall. The
    warden had little intention of entering the red forest at this time, but
    scouting the streets nearby was a necessary matter.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    There was nothing to be found, the only annoyance remained the rain.
    Augustus could see the gate leading into Forever Fall was sealed off by a
    lone Huntsmen. Whatever Grimm <i>he’d</i> slain were long gone.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Has anything changed?” He floated over to the guardian, his hands in his
    coat pockets.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, Augustus. I’ve found nothing. The Grimm numbers haven’t rose, but they
    haven’t gone <i>down,</i> either. The recent spike hasn’t swayed,
    suggesting foul play.” Stam filled him in, cracking his knuckles. “I take
    it you’ve looked into this? We don’t know who, or <i>what</i> is causing
    this yet, right? If we did, we wouldn’t be here now.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I can’t say for sure, but we have an idea.” Augustus fixed his glasses.
    “I’d stay here with you. We could even go inside, but I’m needed at the
prison. When it comes to sources, Dimitri knows almost everything a man    <i>could</i> know about Remnant’s secrets. Least, that’s what I’ve been
    told.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “As civilians bed down, their thoughts recede, and the negativity subsides.
    I’ll probably leave here myself in a matter of minutes. Let’s just hope
    this is the worst of it.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If you ever need help, ring me.” Augustus wallowed away, his jacket
    struggling to unfurl under the weight of the water. If he was right about
    his hunches, there weren’t any reasons to believe the Grimm would leave. No
    point in telling Stam <i>that,</i> though.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Augustus was recognizable as the Warden of the very facility named after
    him, but not to the ignorant eyes of the general public. Thus his habit to
    travel through the night was emboldened by the lack of citizens. A shortcut
    between two buildings would prove beneficial, however. It was this route
    that led him right to someone in need.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hello? Are you there?” He swiveled around at the sound of crying. Staring
    him in the shades was a <i>young girl,</i> wearing mystical robes and
    sporting a visual condition Augustus had never seen. Light radiated off of
her digital physique. He couldn’t be blamed for assuming the ghost to be a    <i>projection,</i> some result of Atlesian technology. “A hologram?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“W-Who are you?”</i>
    The girl stuttered.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m the Warden of Augustus Correctional.” He glided over to her and
    crouched down.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“W-What’s that?”</i>
    A permanent stream of tears locked itself onto her face, almost stuck in a
    stasis.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s where we keep the bad guys, here in Vale. What’s your name?” He tried
    smiling to comfort her.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-It’s Ella. This is Vale?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s right. Are you lost?” Augustus proceeded to state his name. She
nodded. One would assume her to be afraid of somebody as frankly    <i>terrifying</i> as him, but she herself was a real specimen. It’s as if
    they were waging a competition for the bigger outcast. “You’re blue. I
    can’t say I’ve seen a specimen such as you… But I’m interested to see if
    the <i>Administrator</i> has. Let’s get you back with your family.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“F-Family?”</i>
    Ella paused, then followed against her judgment, realizing he was her only
    hope for relief.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah, family. You got one, right?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I... I-I can’t remember.” Her tear streaks grew more prominent. His
    expression changed to one of sadness as well. “We’re going to get you
    home.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Home…” She struggled to keep up with his pace. It was then that the blade
    strapped to his back unclipped. It had a mechanical constitution with
    electrical components visible, and a bronze coil for a handle. And in
    falling to the floor, its impact was masked by the hailstorm. “O-Oh! You
    dropped this!” Ella scrambled to pick up the scimitar by the handle.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Augustus turned and watched her <i>attempt</i> to lift the conductive
    cutter. Touching it sent sparks everywhere, somehow a result of her
    automated skin. Ella gasped and dropped it.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’ve got it. Let’s go.” An arcane movement of his hand, and the sword was
    enveloped in the same black smoke that seeped from his trench coat. The
    weapon returned to his back, divulging his capacity for levitation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “H-How did you do that?” Ella was referring to his unnatural ability to
    control the sword in particular, not to mention his lower’s body’s
    transition into a hellish vapor.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Simply the work of my semblance.” He told her. Their trip back to the
    prison was about as uneventful as one would expect. Not to worry though.
    Everything escalated to a simmer once their goal appeared at hand.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The treatment center’s title was imprinted on a metal archway. Ella read it
    out and shivered. They were on the very borders between Vale and the ocean,
    a colossal path stretching over the limitless waters towards the complex.
    Every gate on the opposite end was opened for Augustus without question.
    Ella gulped. They were miles above the reefs. A set of monumental pillars
    lingered as the only reason they could rest at ground level rather than
    plunge into the depths.
    <p>

    “Warden.” An associate greeted the leader upon his entry. “You’re here. We
    got Dimitri, just like you ordered.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He’s of no use to me dead.” Augustus’s face dropped.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t worry, he’s very alive.” The minion tensed. “Idiot wouldn’t shut up
    the entire time I was with him. He’s locked in the Crypt, with every
    available man we’ve got watching the door.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t be silly. He’s not leaving the <i>Crypt. </i>You can call them off.
    There’s plenty more our force could do than stare at a wall. I’m on my way
    there anyway.” Augustus reprimanded the lackey. Before leaving the lobby
    with his new accomplice, a visitor caught his eye. “And who might you be?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh! My name’s Nadia.” She stood up from a row of seats. “I helped catch
    Dimitri.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Helped?</i>
Had it not been for her, he’d have gotten away before we were anywhere    <i>near</i> the scene!” The same chief cut in.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Really? You must be a Huntress, then.” Augustus nodded in earnest.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Only in training. I-It was nothing.” Her face reddened until she spotted
    the blue latecomer, being the first one to notice a pair of bony horns poke
    from the specter‘s hair. Her hood was pulled down. “Who’s this?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I found <i>Ella</i> on my travels. She remembers not where she came from
    nor how she got here.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh… That’s unfortunate. Maybe I could help out.” Nadia suggested.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t see what you could do right now, plus you’ve been plenty of help
    already. I couldn’t-“
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“No,</i>
    it’s fine! Anything!” Nadia wouldn’t take no for an answer. This departure
    from her reserved, contemplated attitude was complacent when it came to
    Ella, interestingly enough.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well, perhaps you can take her to the rehab site.” Augustus gestured for
    Ella to join Nadia. “It’s in the East Wing- Sector Two-One-Four. You’ll
    find it. I’d help you, but I have my own matters to attend. I’ll notify my
    staff you’re on your way. Do this favor, and you can leave by my command-
    nobody will stop you.” He was already sailing away. Nadia shrugged at her
    partner. With a few directions and perseverance, it wasn’t long before the
    aforementioned East Wing was reached.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “W-Why help me? You don’t even know me.” Ella looked away.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Maybe I’m just fond of you.” Nadia showed off her signature grin,
    prompting a very meek Ella to try the same.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Thanks. Where do <i>you</i> come from?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Beacon Academy.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Beacon? W-What’s that?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s a combat school where my friends and I stay. You should come sometime
    now that you’re one of them.” Nadia guided her further in, looking for any
    indication they’d entered the right place.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “F-Friend? I’ve never had a friend...”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well, Ella, it’s an honor to be your first!” She prepped a successful
    handshake.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You must be the ones the Warden warned us about. Nadia and Ella, right?” A
    patrolman of <i>Sector Two-One-Four</i> correctly identified them. “We can
    take it from here.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Alright then. See you soon!” Nadia let them take her friend away before
    Ella could voice dissent. Backtracking was a daunting task, but one that
    was tackled without any <i>real</i> setback. On her way out of the lobby,
    Nadia was reminded of the enigmatic Augustus. The last <i>she’d</i> seen of
    him, he was levitating down the chilling penitentiary in search of the
    Crypt.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The thug waited, one hand holding up his chin and the other tapping the
    reflective surface, cuffed to a chain strapped to the wall. There were two
    things in the Crypt: A metal block of a table, and Dimitri himself. The
    place was roomy and very <i>open,</i> considering a padded cell of this
    type would generally invoke the opposite feeling. Red stains settled
    everywhere, the icing on the cake.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Augustus entered the room through several doors secured with either keypads,
    padlocks, latch sequences, vault cranks, or a combination of all four. Each
    one was locked behind him. “You must be Dimitri. I hope your schedule’s
    clear.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It is now.” He grumbled. The smugness persisted even in this
    disadvantageous position.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “A birdie said you knew a lot of about Remnant. Told me you get around a
    lot. Plenty of sought after fighters. I don’t care about that- I’m only
    interested in a select few.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Eh, if that’s what it takes for a guy to catch a break in this hotel, I’m
    all ears. Fire away.” Dimitri bobbed his head back and forth.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Know any Delphics?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If you keep making up words, how am I ever going to answer your gibberish
    questions?” Dimitri checked his watch.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Delphics</i>
    are a rare creed. Humanoid in nature, they differ in <i>behavior</i> by
    having an appearance and instinct mimicking the abilities possessed by
    Remnant’s most prehistoric enemy, at one point having been spawned from the
    darkness- the <i>Creatures of Grimm.</i> <i>Understand?...</i> Now that
    I’ve given you information, it’s your turn.” Augustus leaned forward, ready
    to savor whatever incoming data his new informant had.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Why the hell would I know a <i>Delphic?</i> <i>You</i> could be a    <i>Delphic</i> for all I know.” Dimitri seemed agitated, but started
    laughing at the absurdity of the situation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I see. Let me check something. Can you hold this for a second?” He held
    his conductive sword forward.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oho! Now <i>that’s</i> one for the postcards! This’d fit in great with my
    crowbar! <i>Mind telling me where it is?”</i>
    <i>
        No response.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Augustus was swiping through his scroll. The cutlass exploded in a frenzy
    of lightning, sending arcs of the lethal bolts everywhere. Augustus seemed
    unaffected, the zaps having no impact on him, and his glasses blocking the
    insipid strobe sensation. One could only imagine how <i>Dimitri</i> felt
    about it, not only in the center of the blast, but <i>channeling</i> it,
    unable to let go. Perhaps the pain was dulled by the senseless laughing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
Time froze for Dimitri, but flew for his torturer.    <i>“Aghh! <b>Hahahahahahaaa!”</b></i> The torment at long last came to an
    end. Even though Dimitri was stunned and temporarily unable to move a
    muscle in his body, the sword slipped out of his clenched fingers onto the
    floor’s fabric.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Not gonna talk? Okay. I love my job.” Augustus recalled his blade and
    rested it on Dimitri’s shoulder. The crime lord dozed out of his slumber
    with a howl.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>“Hahahaha!</i></b>
    <i>
        That all you got, sparky? No, no, I’ll humor you. Repeat the question!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I just wanna know where the Delphics are.” He went back to reading his
    scroll, acting unreasonably lax.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If I knew where the Delphics were, I’d tell you buddy! What does a guy
    like me have to lose from snitching?” Dimitri’s voice suggested he still
    didn’t have a clue what a Delphic even was despite the poetic explanation,
    but either way he wasn’t <i>afraid</i> of further punishment. He wasn’t
    going to roll over.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Okay. I’ll undo your chains.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Heehee. What’s the catch?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It might get in the way, and you need to focus now, because If you want to
    glimpse the <i>light…”</i> Augustus was a man of a word, hovering over and
    unlatching the bond from Dimitri’s wrist.
    <i>
        “You must brave the
        <b>
            darkness!”
            <p>
            </p>
        </b>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    His bony finger tapped Dimitri on the shoulder, blasting him with nightmare
    mist. The electrical agony was one thing, <i>this</i> was another beast
    entirely. A mixture of purple and red cinders swirled around Dimitri, the
    charcoal haze encompassing him. Like the previous trick, Dimitri could do
    nothing but jolt around in place, screaming in hysterics. Thus, even as
    Augustus unlocked every seal to leave, escape wasn’t an option.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Hmm hm, hm hmm!”</i>
    Augustus mumbled his madhouse’s jingle, closing the last door and sealing
    the shrieks away. The interrogation continued inside, Dimitri’s misery
    presumably unhindered.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Tonight had been a trial for our heroes with inner turmoil, lost souls, and
    lawless brawlers. Questions remained the only fruits of their labor.
    Remnant was willing to throw these enigmas into the mix without a second
    thought. Concerning <i>answers,</i> however, further research was needed.
