<div class=WordSection1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center'><i>Entry 2: <span style='color:#806000'>Fairytales,
Falsehoods, and Forgotten Fables</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Day had finally
broke, and with it any chance of sleeping in. The first array of classes would determine
once and for all whether or not our heroes were ready for the challenges ahead.
Challenge number <i>one:</i> wake up before nine o’clock in the morning. Half
of Team Lance had already passed. As Selene rose from the westernmost bed, she
let out a noteworthy yawn. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Good
morning. I trust you slept well?” Lucifer sat idle in a chair positioned in the
opposite corner. His glowing eyes were the only reason to believe he was awake.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yep! But
I’m not sure <i>he</i> did.” She gave Merlin a hug. “Yesterday must have taken
a toll on him.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“He’ll walk
it off. He always does.” The clock, being the bearer of bad news, claimed they
only had thirty minutes to do everything they needed to. “I guess it falls to <i>me</i>
to be the alarm? I haven’t the slightest clue when they’d <i>like</i> to wake,
but I have a feeling I’m about to find out.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Have fun
with that!” She retreated to the washroom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Nadia.</i>
It’s time to get up.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“H-Huh? Oh.
It’s just you.” Nadia opened her eyes to see the tech-toting cadet stand before
her, his arms crossed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It’s <i>just</i>
me. And it’s also <i>just</i> eighty-thirty. Does that work for you?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It’s fine.
Thank you.” She sat up. “It’s not an issue at all, but consider greeting early
birds with a more <i>friendly </i>face. It’ll brighten their day!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I see.
Let’s give it a try.” Lucifer grabbed ahold of the closet’s handle and pulled. <i>“Locked…</i>
Hello?” He tried again. “Hello?! <i>Argh.” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>He slammed
his fist on the door a few times. “It’s time to wake up!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Shhh!”</i>
Nadia got his attention by tensing up. “Remember: <i>Friendly!”           </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Right.”</i>
He took on a more joyful yet sarcastic persona, flexing his hand a few times
just to give the door a few light taps. <i>“Wakey, wakey.</i> Hello in there,
it’s time to wake up!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“What!?</i>
What do you want!?” Alecto wrenched it open, wearing full armor. He
contemplated saying something, but wasn’t given the chance. She slammed the
door back in his face. Lucifer craned his neck in anger then looked at Nadia. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Friendly!”</i>
She emphasized. He nodded and left the closet without a word. “So, you really didn’t
mind sleeping on the floor?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Affirmative.”
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Wait. Is
that a yes, you did mind? Or <i>yes,</i> you <i>didn’t?”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Affirmative.”
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh, now I
see... Anyway, I bet since you were willing to take one for the team, that
armor has a lot of cushion. Then again, it would have to, considering how much damage
you took in that Grover fight. That was impressive!” The windows were swept
open thanks to her. The morning dew smelled pleasant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You don’t
have to remind me.” He sat back down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It’ll keep
you on your toes though!” She giggled. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“That’s
always a concern when <i>you’re</i> around, isn’t it? I’m not complaining, a
rogue will fit well on this team.” In the brief moment Lucifer had looked away,
she was already gone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Glad to
hear it!” Nadia finished the vanishing act by blinking up next to him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You’ll be
perfect for the job.” He nodded. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hya!”
Alecto kicked the closet open and swung her sword forth, seemingly practicing
her technique. Between that and the slamming door, she was making a great
racket. Such skill brimmed with passion and fury was a delight, but it quickly
died out. “You know, these training rounds just aren’t doing it for me. Not
doing it at all. There must be <i>some</i> sort of practice area on these
grounds.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You could
always go outside.” Lucifer pointed at the window. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What do you
want me to jump!?” She stomped on the ground.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You can
handle the fall, I know you can. I saw it just <i>yesterday.”</i> He continued
the banter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Alecto went
back to sparring <i>nobody</i>, leaping around the middle of the room. “Don’t
even get me started.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I wouldn’t
dare.” He shook his head, bemused. “…And we’re on the top floor- all the more
reason to swing your sword somewhere else. Otherwise we’ll have a load of
preemptive <i>pals</i> at our doorstep.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I dare them
to come. They’ll understand my plea as soon as they see what I’ve got to work
with!” To punctuate her confidence, a batch of knocks tested the entry-door. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Case in
point.” As head of Team Lance, Lucifer opened up to represent his partners. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Sorry to
intrude.” A complete stranger holding a blanket blocked the doorway. “But I’m
from the next dorm over, and I’m trying to get some sleep. Can you guys keep it
down in here?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Lucifer
looked over at the one responsible for all the noise. “It’s for you.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Who are
you?” Alecto took his place to greet their guest. Whoever it was, they managed
to fit in right amongst the varied chaos of Team Lance. <i>Sickly skin, flaming
eyes</i>, and <i>horns.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Sorry, I forgot.
My name’s <i>Zara.</i> Now can you guys just bring the noise down a bit?” One
could tell by the nature of her voice she was barely awake. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Got it. Now
go get some sleep.” Alecto closed the door. A wave of suspicion overtook Zara,
prompting her to stay and gauge their honesty. Hardly any time passed before
the sounds of mayhem further seeped through the walls. She hammered the door
harder this time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Who is it?”
Alecto repeated the procedure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I want you
to <i>keep it down.”</i> Zara’s eyes flared up, sending a plume of smoke and flames
to the ceiling. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Sorry about
her!” Nadia emerged between them. “We’ll be quieter. Hope you have a good
sleep!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I might <i>now…”</i>
Zara grumbled. Her departure back down the passage confirmed they <i>were</i>
being more considerate. Although there wasn’t much time left till classes would
begin at this point.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center'>Several Minutes Later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The lecture
halls of Beacon Academy were large, yes, but it did nothing to quell the anxiety
of its inhabitants. Nearly all three teams were settled in, the professor
sitting in a chair with his feet on the desk. Everyone waited, watching the
clock, while <i>he</i> enjoyed a nice game on his scroll. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Alright!
Welcome, class! My name <i>is…”</i> He rose to scribble two words on the
whiteboard. “Professor Stamatios, but you will call me <i>‘Professor Stam.’</i>
First name: <i>Professor.</i> Last name: <i>Stam. </i>Now I’m going to call
your names.<i> </i>I may mispronounce them- so I apologize in advance. Like
everything, it’s a learning experience.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Disregarding
the very end, roll call went by without a hitch. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Zara
Haken?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The newcomer
entered the room right as he called her, answering while sitting down next to
her team. She raised her hand. “Here! Oh, um, sorry I’m late but I was
wondering-“ </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Nonsense!
It’s not late unless you’re here <i>after</i> your name was called, Miss Haken.
If you think <i>that’s</i> bad, you should have seen me on <i>my</i> first day!
Actually no, you shouldn’t.” Stam’s voice boomed forth, and it didn’t seem like
he was even trying. “Now, it seems you have a question! Let’s hear it!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I-Is this
the class for <i>‘Combat Application?’”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“No, it’s Aura
Education.” Stam pulled her leg. Everybody scrambled to pack their things and
leave, thinking they were in the wrong place. “W-Wait! Stop, I was joking!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>After the
wave of panic passed, Stam resumed his lecture. “Now don’t think I didn’t
notice. None of you have followed <i>Beacon’s Dress Code.</i> However… I find
your various apparel far more colorful, not to mention affective for <i>combat</i>-
the focus of this class. I do not know nor care about your other instructors
but, with Headmaster Ozpin’s permission of course, we care not for uniforms here.
If we did, I wouldn’t be wearing <i>this.”</i> He gestured to the crossing
guard’s vest fit over his suit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Also
there’s one rule: be respectful. Alright, rules <i>done.</i> I’m not about talk,
I’m about <i>action.</i> So bore the formalities, we will not improve by
waiting. The staff here at Beacon Academy are preparing you for combat out on
the <i>field.</i> So in this class, we go to the <i>field.”</i> The class lit
up. “When we aren’t sparring, we’re out on field trips as we are today. Our journey
will take us to <b><i>Summit’s Blight. ”</i></b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>In no time
at all, the new professor had sorted his students onto the first available
bullhead and shipped them away into the unforgiving cliffs resting to the east.
Summit’s Blight stretched in all directions, a vast collection of gloomy peaks
with no end. From the inside, there appeared to be no true exit. Remnant smiled
on the trespassers this day, sparing them from the endless rain- though the
thunder persisted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Alright
students! Here’s a hardy welcome to Summit’s Blight.” Professor Stam strolled
in front of the airship, the teams standing at ease. “This place is infested.
You must be careful. As we go lower the weaker grimm will thin out in favor of
stronger ones, but you’re still welcome to <i>cautiously</i> venture down there.”
Alecto hand rose into the air. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Is that
extra credit?” She asked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Well Miss
Keraseer, keep in mind your assignment is merely to hone your skills in the
wild. Taking on tougher grimm will reward you in the form of greater
experience! I only ask you try!” Even though he shot down her hopes, he was <i>almost</i>
enthusiastic enough to make up for it. <i>Almost.</i> Next Nadia offered a
question. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Um, sorry,
but what happens if we get lost, or we’re in trouble?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We’ll be
fine, there’s no way those-“ Alecto started.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Brilliant
question!” Professor Stam probably didn’t even hear himself talk over her.
“There’s one thing you must remember. When your time within Beacon is over, you
will stand on your <i>own.</i> I won’t be there to help you. Why start now? You
won’t learn from <i>me</i> solving all your problems. So although I will <i>generally</i>
refrain from fighting on your behalf, I will periodically check up on each of
you. If you truly are in a compromising situation, simply yell. <i>I will be
there.” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>He assigned
each team a direction, eventually coming to Lucifer and his band of allies. “Ah
yes, Mister <i>Virtus.</i> It’s a pleasure to have you in my class. Although
it’s a tad uncharted, you are to explore the <i>northern front.”</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I
understand.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Actually,
Mister Virtus…” Professor Stam stroked his beard. “Come to think of it, your
team is <i>more</i> than capable...” He then garnered the attention of <i>another</i>
team waltzing away. “Miss Haken!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yes?” Zara
herself returned. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’ve come
to a realization. There should be <i>somebody</i> to guard the airship in our
absence. So while the rest of you are busy out there accumulating the spoils of
combat, these two will stay <i>here</i> and learn <i>patience.”</i> He gestured
to a certain member of Team Lance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“M-Me?” Selene
squawked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What!?”
Lucifer contained his outburst. “But can’t <i>you</i> stay and watch?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I can watch
you, or I can watch the Bullhead. But I’m afraid as much as I’d like to, I cannot
do both.” He crossed his arms, everyone else filing away. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“But doesn’t
she need the combat experience?” He tried again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Don’t
worry, this’ll hardly be a rare occurrence. Her time will come.” By the tone of
his voice it was clear he wasn’t going to budge. Before further dissent could
voice itself, he was already gone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“If you need
anything, signal me. Right away, alright?” Lucifer threw himself between the
ship’s two new guardians.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“O-Okay.”
She nodded. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>He turned
his attention to Zara, able to effortlessly spook her with one hollow
statement. “Keep her safe.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Team Lance,
with the exception of their youngest member, trekked off into the depths of
Summit’s Blight. Not all was bad though, some crackling thunder was happy to
greet them with open arms. The trio danced down a rocky trail without much
problem, save for the occasion grimm fodder and playful bickering. It was hard
to tell which one was worse. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Maybe you
can start coming <i>here</i> to train.” Lucifer remarked. “Plenty of targets for
you to fight.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Unfortunately
<i>you</i> aren’t one of them.” Alecto laughed. “Besides, you seem perfect for
this place. Gray on gray.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Well if
that’s all it takes, then we’re <i>both</i> misplaced.” One more step and they
reached a massive crater. A huge wooden gate could be seen at the bottom,
presumably leading deep into the mountain. Even without it, the nearby plaque
and carved staircase downward showed that whatever this location was, it wasn’t
made by <i>grimm. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Anti-Citadel.”</i>
Nadia read out engravings on the stone sign. “I wonder what that means.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“How about
we go find out?” Alecto chuckled. In response an eerily loud screech vibrated
the mountains, one so blaringly outrageous even Alecto began rethinking her own
suggestion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You heard
that, right?” Nadia looked around, suddenly paranoid. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’m having
trouble hearing at all, now.” Alecto said. “What <i>was</i> that?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“A grimm.”
Lucifer stated the obvious, looking back where he’d come. The look of concern
was indistinguishable through his mask. Turning his attention back forward
revealed how he was lagging behind, the other two fighters already hiking down
into the <i>Anti-Citadel. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The crows
above never stopped circling nor cawing. But their presence grew less
noticeable the further down one went, appearing only as imperfections in the
clouds once the bottom had been met. As their size shrunk, the direful gate’s
size inflated. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We’re going
in <i>there?”</i> Nadia pointed at the scarily primitive door. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Dark, dank,
plus I’ve got a terrible feeling about it.” Alecto nodded. “All the more reason
to suspect there’s grimm inside.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The paladin
took charge, pulling the double-door open. Even when squinting and raising the
face-plate of her horned helm, she couldn’t see very far inside. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Huh. Hey!”
Alecto called to Lucifer. He wasn’t paying attention. “What are we supposed to
do now?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>He walked up
beside her. His willingness to foolishly look through the emptiness brought
similar results. To an outsider it appeared as though his eyes switched off,
blinking out for half a second just to return. Only this time, they were green
rather than orange. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What’s the
plan?” Nadia knew he was up to something. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Night-vision.”
He outlined his entire way of thinking with a simple phrase. Perhaps part of
that plan was almost completely losing to the darkness before his teammates
caught up with him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hold up,
speedy!” Alecto put both her hands on his shoulder. “I don’t have <i>‘night
vision!’</i> What are <i>we</i> supposed to do!?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hold on as
you are now. We have to keep moving.” He resumed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ugh. This
is insane.” She did as told, but she didn’t have to be happy about it. Nadia
completed the train by holding onto the crusader’s shoulders. Metal and soft
footsteps were the only auditory guide provided. At a certain point, Nadia felt
is appropriate to lighten the mood with some humming. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Hmm, hm-
hmm! Hm hmmmm!”</i> She shook her head back forth, almost dancing with her
steps. But even with the uplifting tune, grimm were perceptive enough to detect
them. Creeps weren’t particularly dangerous, but considering the lack of vision
it wasn’t a <i>great</i> situation. At the slightest sound of treachery, Alecto
leaped away and drew her sword. Even if offense wasn’t an option in the dark,
blanket defense could stall. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Wait for my
call!” The role of assaulter fell to Lucifer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What does <i>that</i>
mean!?” She didn’t inspire much confidence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Just attack
when I tell you!” The reverbs of brutal combat could be heard, Alecto grateful
most of the weight had been lifted from her shoulders but disappointed she
couldn’t participate herself. As for Nadia, the assassin was out of sight and
mind, using <i>sound</i> to migrate around the battlefield and bring a swift
end to her adversaries. One four-needle stab was all it took for grimm of <i>this</i>
nature. The only evidence Lucifer was still there was his lucent pupils. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Now!” Once
it became too much, Lucifer tossed a batch in front of Alecto. Springing into
action, she was able to create a semi-sufficient picture of her foes from the
way her short sword cleft through them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Behind you!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Falling
solely on his word, she swooped around and swung with precision despite the shrouding
effect at play. It worked. Chunks of grimm were lost to the fog of the tunnel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“That was
the last of them.” Lucifer said. Nadia let out a sigh of relief and revealed
herself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Was it now?
Okay, not bad.” Alecto sheathed her blade and reached forward for Lucifer’s
shoulders, Nadia doing the same. Now that they were back on a straight shot
down the makeshift subway, it wasn’t long before a lone light reminded them
they <i>weren’t</i> blind. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Finally! I
can see!” Alecto ran forward. The lamp gave her the lay of the land. Ever since
they’d passed the great entrance, all that presented itself was a colossal mine
dug into Summit’s Blight, a gigantic hole cut deep into the mountain. It continued
even still, but at least now the exit was within reach. After such a tremendous
channel the door on the other side was almost underwhelming, a simple oak gateway
with a bulky wooden frame. Behind it rested more caverns. But while the three
heroes were exploring the depths below, far <i>above</i> another quest was
brewing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>After some
basic conversation between Selene and Zara, an intense bellow tamed the
heavens- the exact same roar that spiked fear into their friends. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I really
wish my friend Merlin was with me. He wasn’t feeling well today, but he could
protect us.” Selene and Zara sat on the floor of the bullhead with their legs
hanging off. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We don’t
need protecting. We can fight!” Zara swung one of her hooks around. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Woah! Can I
see?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ha. Sure.”
She handed one over. “They’re like exaggerated fish hooks. And check this out.”
Having already given her <i>left</i> sickle-like weapon away, she pulled out
her <i>right</i> duplicate. The hook used red dust to heat up until flames
slipped off of the red-hot metal. Zara appeared immune to the blistering
effects. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“That’s
really cool! I wish I had something like that.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Well what
do <i>you</i> fight with?” They slipped back onto Zara’s back with ease. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I-I can’t
really do it right now.” Selene sheepishly admitted. “I can try, though.” She
hopped off the aircraft and closed her eyes, concentrating. But nothing came
forth. “Sorry.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’m sure
I’ll get to see it eventually. Even if your team caused me to <i>almost</i> be
late, we’ll probably be seeing a lot of each other. I mean, our dorms <i>are</i>
right next to each other.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh, sorry
about that! I guess they can get sort of loud sometimes.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Honestly my
own team isn’t much better.” Zara twirled her hair. “That reminds me, who <i>was</i>
that with you? The one with armor.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                                                                                                                                                                        </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Which one
with armor?” Selene snickered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“The guy
with red eyes? He’s got, like, <i>smoke</i> coming out of his helmet?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh! That’s
Lucifer! That’s actually not smoke, it’s mist. He-“ Selene’s eyes lit up, but
the sound of falling rocks got both their attention. Remembering their purpose
for being here in the first place, Zara was hesitant but willing to
investigate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Around a
large formation of boulders they witnessed an ominous figure. He was facing
away from them, glaring at the one segment of the sky where sun penetrated the
clouds. A coat with ancient-looking symbols emblazoned on the back remained
strapped to his shoulders, catching the wind. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The drifter
was positioned at the end of a cliff, his feet mere inches from the edge. To
say it was an unnerving sight would be putting it lightly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“H-Hello?”
Zara broke the silence, not knowing whether or not the stranger knew their
presence. He turned his head. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><b><i>“…Your

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Y-Yeah?
What about it?” She asked. Selene hid behind her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“It’s…
not important. What are you two doing here?”</i> His antlers couldn’t be
missed, even as he turned around to fully face them. They stuck high into the
air. <i>“It’s dangerous to roam these mountains. There’s too many grimm. It’s no
place for children. You should leave.”</i> The faunus’s appearance conveyed
evil intent, with his eyes curving down. But his voice, if sinister, seemed
more curious than anything. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We’re here
from Beacon Academy, and it’s up to us to keep the area clear of enemies, even
if they aren’t <i>grimm.”</i> Zara clarified, becoming oddly suspicious. She armed
herself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><b><i>“Beacon
Academy?”</i></b> His eyes were stuck on her hooks. <b><i>“…I am merely an

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“There are
no allies.” Zara shook her head. The deer paused, then let out an unusual laugh.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“You’re
right about one thing. This place isn’t safe.”</i> His smile was already faint
to begin with, but it completely faded as he gazed back at the sun. Setting his
sights back on Zara alerted him to a lurking beowolf. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The wanderer
whipped out an archaic crossbow and fired before the good duo could react. The
bolt zipped past them and impaled the creature, killing it instantly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…O-Okay.
Fine, you’re an <i>ally.”</i> It took a moment but Zara realized the nuance of
the situation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“An ally,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What!? But
the bullhead! It was right here!” She was right. Although she couldn’t have
moved more than fifty feet away and around a stack of oversized pebbles, the
same path back brought a <i>completely</i> different environment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><b><i>“You’re

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Lost?”
Selene gasped. “How did we get lost? That doesn’t make any sense!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Perhaps.
Summit’s Blight is not the place for lone travelers. Your knowledge, any combat

the wake of his rant the group paced forward in silence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Zara!”
Selene uttered. “Are you sure we should follow this guy? We don’t even know who

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I know, but
I think he might know how to find the bullhead. Do you think we should leave
him? I mean, you’re kind of right. He doesn’t really have anything to gain by
helping us.” She crouched down and spoke in breathless whispers, making sure
their conversation remained private. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“You will

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Well how
about we start with something simple? What’s your name?” Selene pitched in. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Hmph.
Meaningless conjecture.” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Well…
You’re just roaming around here, so how about <i>Nomad?</i> That’s a ‘roamy’
sort of name!” Selene suggested. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“I
suppose I won’t stop you.”</i> <i>Nomad</i> came to a halt. He looked around,
studying the area. The last thing they’d expect him to do was approach the
nearby deep trench. <i>“Over here. It appears we’re at an impasse.” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yeah, I
noticed.” Zara sarcastically remarked. Nomad turned and glanced at her whilst
Selene peaked into the canyon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“That looks
like a long fall…” She deplored. He looked forward, past the dilapidated
stretch of hills into the distance. A somber expression broke through for but a
moment, but it was hastily suppressed. He shook his head. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“We
cannot go around, only over. This ravine is deep, not wide.”</i> Without even
trying, Nomad crossed the gap by means of leaping. It was almost unnatural how
effortlessly he flew across, with the way his jacket never left his shoulders. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Alright, my
turn.” Zara twirled her hooks around and threw them across, aiming for a rocky
peninsula above. <i>Success!</i> “Selene, hold on.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“O-Okay…”
She reluctantly accepted her hand. “You know what you’re doing, right?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You
couldn’t be in better hands!” They swung across with no problem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Your
skill with that weapon, if unusual, is admirable.”</i> Nomad was far from
impressed, but there was nothing to complain about <i>yet. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Thanks?” Zara
dusted her knees off. Ahead a crank in the shape of a circle locked a rather
large door. Zara tried to pull it down, but it wouldn’t budge a bit. It might
as well have been <i>attached</i> to the hatch for all the progress she made. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Grimm
will come.”</i> Nomad was captivated by the wheel. He was already cranking it,
forcing the ore-bound opening to pivot down. He wasn’t having much trouble, it
almost seemed to<i> annoy</i> him. <i>“Do not hesitate to kill them.” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>As predicted
a batch of new enemies crawled onto the mountainside. The otherworldly ally was
unconcerned, not even looking back. Selene stumbled behind Zara, and the
goat-faunus herself heated up her hooks. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>While they
certainly presented a challenge, they would need larger numbers if they wanted
to pose a real threat to Zara. <i>Selene,</i> however, had little to defend
herself. Through the duel Zara was able to protect her, but at a certain point
a larger beowolf scooped the dual wielder up. Now out of position and grappling
with a slobbering cretin, she was unable to guard Selene. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Ah!</i>
H-Help me!” The princess was cornered, although she made the smart decision to
fall over into Nomad’s peripheral vision. He looked over, yawning at the crank
that no one else could even move, and tossed her his crossbow. Selene was in
too much of a rush to appreciate the intricate engravings or genius
engineering, more concerned with figuring out how to even <i>fire</i> it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Despite
fumbling with it, she had seen Lucifer fight enough to know one thing: <i>pull
the trigger.</i> It worked, and she had the beowolf’s animalistic nature to
thank. It ran her down, almost practically in front of her, so she couldn’t
miss. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“If we
don’t move, we’ll never get out of here.” </i>Nomad gently pulled her to her feet.
He was pleased to see Zara return in line with his command. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh, um, thanks.
This is yours.” Selene held the repeater up with both hands for him to retrieve
it. This new location would have been easily recognizable if either of the
teenagers had been there before. Selene, and to a lesser extent Zara, had to
watch their footing as a thin stone bridge connected two adjacent cliffs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Now was the
worst time for the iconic roaring to return. The floor on which they stood
riveted back and forth, and another round of frantic shrieking echoed throughout
Summit’s Blight. Neither of Beacon’s representatives had experienced anything
like it save for the <i>first</i> time they’d heard it, at the bullhead. “What
keeps doing that?” Selene asked. Nomad had the answers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><b><i>“The
Grand Gatekeeper</i></b><i> is a massive grimm plaguing Summit’s Blight, a
horrible hybrid beast with six legs. Try not to dwell on it.”</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You mean
like a spider?” Zara shivered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“In
appearance perhaps, but not in practice. Leave it be.”</i> Once they’d reached
the other side, Nomad stopped them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What is
it?” Zara questioned the leader as he looked around. The area’s physical
description seemed to hold great value to him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Nothing.
This is the right path.”</i> The direction he chose appeared completely
arbitrary despite his great deliberation. Time would tell whether or not it
would yield results. Even if it didn’t though, it <i>did</i> bring a great
view.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Wooow.</i>
We’re really high up.” Selene’s eyes shimmered. Zara sighed as well, taking in
it, both of them jogging past the cloaked foreigner towards the ledge. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“We’re
nowhere near the top, nor are we trying to be.”</i> Nomad hinted at an even
better peak with an even greater view. But he was about as interested in that
one as he was <i>this</i> one. The crossbow was pointed far into the sky and
ignited, a bolt zooming through the air. The navigator almost missed the
spectacle, but it was clear to see. The bolt faded out of existence before it even
reached the clouds. Crossing his arms and studying his unlikely alliance, he
noticed Selene’s tiara- <i>golden vines holding up a darkened gem. <b>“Interesting...”</b>
</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                                                                                                                   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Higher and
higher the party travelled under the watchful eye of Nomad, meanwhile their <i>associates</i>
were doing the opposite, charging deeper below. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You’re
still here right, Nadia?” Alecto couldn’t tell if Nadia’s presence was lost due
to her semblance or the lack of light. The torch helped out but those standing
on its cramped outskirts didn’t receive full benefits. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yep, yep!”
Her words bounced around the damp passage. “Haha, I’ve always wanted to do
this! <i>Timber!”</i> She shouted. Her words returned soon after. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You’re
having too much fun.” Lucifer mixed a snort and laugh. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“I’m</i>
just wondering where all the grimm are. Who knows, maybe they’ll turn up past
here.” Alecto made an educated guess. She was half right. Tiptoeing past the
splintery archway and around the corner brought them face to face with a truly
intimidating entity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ah, Team
Lance! Glad to see you’ve made it this far!” Professor Stam congratulated them.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“P-Professor
Stam?” The crew voiced their unease in unison. Their teacher was sitting in a
foldable chair, reading a magazine under the light of his scroll, surrounded by
teeming caves and ruined masts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Don’t mind
me- just dropping in after checking everyone’s progress to survey your own!
You’re doing great!” If anything could attract more grimm, it would be Stam and
his enthusiastic yelling. He was never out of breath. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I thought
there was only one route here, the one we took.” Lucifer noted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You’re
probably right! Was it the one with the big door?” They nodded. “Ah yes, I
remember my first time at the <i>Anti-Citadel!</i> I was but a young lad just
beginning- actually, that’s another story for another time! I have my work cut
out for me, as you have yours.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh, um,
Professor Stam?” Nadia kept him from running off. “We’ve been killing the
occasional grimm, but there’s been much less than we were expecting.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Maybe
someone else is thinning the herd!” Stam thought out loud. “Tell you what, if
you can show initiative by finding out who, <i>that’ll</i> be extra credit!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Quick!
Let’s go!” Alecto grabbed Nadia’s wrist and pulled her past Lucifer, in a rush
for the bonus points. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Hahaha!”
</i>Stam rested his arms on his chest, spitting out a guttural laugh.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Killing
grimm <i>and</i> getting rewarded for it? I think this might be her dream come
true.” Lucifer added in one more jab at the knight. “I should probably go with
them.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“That’s the
spirit!” Stam let him do just that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Gah!”
Alecto’s excitement was met with a literal smack in the face. A rogue cloth was
carried by the breeze into her path of destruction. The sheet muffled a string
of obscenities up until she ripped it away. Her temptation to threaten whoever
was responsible was replaced with apprehension upon further inspection. It
couldn’t be mistaken for anything else- the red symbol was neon next to the
white fabric. <i>“W-What?”</i> Her voice told a story of surprise and
confusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“A White
Fang Flag!?</i> In the middle of a <i>cave?”</i> Lucifer seethed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Do you
think <i>they’re</i> killing the grimm?” Nadia searched the surroundings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Would this
‘White Fang’ have any reason to?” Alecto finished the bombardment of questions,
handing the flag to her team leader for investigation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Well if
they’re down here, they won’t be up there, where our <i>bullhead</i> waits.”
Lucifer crumpled it up and threw it in the corner. “Let’s make it our mission
to keep it that way.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“But aren’t
we supposed to stay on track and slay grimm?” Alecto raised her sword,
conflicted on whether or not she was welcome to the idea. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You wanted
extra credit? Now’s your chance.” Lucifer dismissed her. Another incessant
scream rumbled the inner mountain, following them wherever they went. Most
likely a result of the so-called <i>Grand Gatekeeper.</i> Grimm never came,
their numbers flat lining despite the constant drop in altitude. But now that a
wild card had been thrown into the mix, Team Lance was on high alert.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’ve never
fought the <i>White Fang</i> before. I’m well versed in what’s called the <i>Old
Fang,</i> but this seems completely different. What are they like?” Alecto
huffed out through her headgear. Nadia piped up this time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“They’re a
rag-tag alliance founded upon the back of an old diety<i>.</i> Their
organization is dedicated to the prosperity of faunus-”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Negative.</i>
The White Fang is a radical brigade, abusing guerilla tactics to take whatever
they want, from <i>whoever</i> they want.” Lucifer sneered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Well… Well
that’s a <i>side</i> of it, I-I guess.” Nadia frowned. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It’s the <i>only</i>
side as far as I’m concerned. Either way, we’re on the <i>right</i> one.” He
retorted. They’d soon arrive at a hole. It was a steep slope with loose granite
chunks lining every inch. Lucifer slid down it without a second thought,
landing even further below the surface- or so he thought. Alecto didn’t question
his brashness, and went on to do the same. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We’re…
above ground?” Lucifer was at a loss for words. Even though a rocky roof kept
the light away, the walls were broken away to display endless stretches of gray
pyramids watching from the distant horizon. “What <i>is</i> this place?
Something’s wrong here.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Guys! Um, I
can’t go down!” Nadia was missing the conundrum, locked above. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Why not?”
Alecto struggled to see her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I-I can’t
dirty my robes…” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Jump! I’ll
catch you!” Her plan was simple. Nadia wasn’t fearful by any means, going with
it. “There you go, princess!” She set her down. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“If I’m the
princess, what does that make Selene?” Nadia joked. Fortunately for her,
Lucifer was tuned out. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Shh!
Listen!”</i> He shut them up. Frantic shouting whirled in their direction.
Whoever it was, their voice was scrawny, shrill, and feeble. His words couldn’t
be made out. “If only we had somebody to recon the area…” Everyone’s eyes fell
on Nadia. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Alright,
alright.” She cracked her knuckled and dissolved. “I’ll be right back!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“So do we
wait for her signal?” Alecto tapped Lucifer’s shoulder. “Won’t that give her
position away?” He contemplated her words, then groaned. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Nadia hummed
to herself, prancing forward, clearly hidden from any witnesses. The strange
yelling persisted as she roamed the terrain, but it didn’t last. Her inner
singing petered out until her thoughts drifted back to Lucifer’s scolding words
of the White Fang. She sighed. She had lost all hope anyone was even here when
the very topic of her daydreaming surprised her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Ack!”</i>
Somebody ran into her. He must have been outrageously sly to have
out-camouflaged <i>Nadia</i> without even trying, and with no invisibility
either. <i>“Wh-who are you!?”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Nadia’s
concentration had been impaired, leaving her open to prying eyes. The little person
before her was dressed in a white coat, and he donned a pointed hat with red
highlights on it. So frail was he that he didn’t even match the teenager’s
height. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“O-Oops!
I’m- uh<i>, nobody!</i> I’m just here on a morning jog, Mister, <i>err…”</i>
She saw on his chest a patch was stitched. On the nametag a series of somewhat
decipherable symbols vaguely resembled the word <i>Herald.</i> “…Herald!” Due
to the lack of a better alternative, the name would have to stick for now. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Eck!</i>
A-A jog!? In Summit’s Blight? Are you sure?” <i>Herald</i> hissed. A reptilian
tail swiveled between his legs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hya!”
Alecto zoomed past her ally in a flash, now behind Herald with her sword around
his throat. Sharp chokeholds seemed to be a favorite of hers. “Quick Nadia,
run! I’ve got him!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Alecto!?”
</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Egh!”
Herald squealed and squirmed out of her grasp with such ease, it actually <i>confused</i>
her. <i>Did she see right? </i>Herald turned thin as <i>paper</i>, took on the
appearance of a <i>sticker,</i> and slipped through her legs away. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“How in
the!?” She swung at nothing at all, like swatting at an especially agile fly. Using
the gusts of her onslaught, the paper-mate blew towards the exit. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Wicked intruders!”
Herald returned to standard physical form. He positioned himself in the frame
of a makeshift door next to his hidden henchmen. “Stop right there!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>His two
cohorts ran past him to subdue the seditionists. Nadia noted something peculiar
about them- they weren’t like standard White Fang grunts. Their uniforms were
slightly different with conflicting masks and red bandages, not to mention
their weaponry lied outside the norm. Each had a small dust-blaster and a… <i>pike
on a stick?</i> Whatever it was, stabbing- and <i>only</i> stabbing- was its
application. Nadia did her best magician’s impression and left the scene. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Herald’s
displeasure at seeing his troops falter to Alecto alone couldn’t be masked. He
backed away, already thinking up a backup plan. It was rudely interrupted by
his <i>third</i> opponent. The soldier dropped in from behind and snuck up on
the commander with a dagger at the ready. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Die!”</i>
Lucifer replicated Alecto’s strategy without knowing her failures. Thus Herald
kept up with the feat of repetition. His semblance worked just as well <i>this</i>
time as it had last time. Alecto finished her bout with an arching slash that
forced the two foes to bow out. She joined Lucifer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Y-You
stragglers don’t belong here!” The Estranged General stuttered with both his threats
and movements, deliberating his next move. He chose a straightforward approach:
<i>run.</i> Herald was faster, but his haste brought him to a very open dead
end, cornered at the edge. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hold it
right there, Light Fang!” Alecto threatened. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><br>
<i>“White</i> Fang.” Lucifer rolled his eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Whatever!</i>
We’ll stop him all the same!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Wait! Eh-
No fair! That’s not going to… <b>nghh!”</b></i> Herald botched his words. At
the first advances of the barbaric insurgents, his semblance triggered on
impulse alone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“No! You <i>slime!”</i>
Lucifer couldn’t stop the wind from carrying Herald far into the clouds, but it
wasn’t over- Lucifer was among the few fighters who made use of <i>ranged</i>
weaponry. His trusty sniper was a great choice, but someone stopped him from
raising the firearm. “Nadia!?” He looked at her in bewilderment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“He’s already
gone.” She shook her head and walked away. Lucifer’s frustration was visible
from his body language, let alone his growling. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We’ll get
him next time!” Alecto’s unfamiliarity with the White Fang helped her optimism,
and as a result she got her team moving towards the nearest path. She noticed
the walls were closing in, forming a sort of tube. But what welcomed them on
the other side would shock them more than Stam, the White Fang, or their
ever-changing environment. After going further and further down this entire
time, taking several twists and turns in a non-linear maze downward, just a
couple meters up for once and they were in the presence of the <i>bullhead.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…I’m never
coming back to this place again.” Lucifer let his head hang back. “Wait a
minute, where’s Selene!?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>They had
somehow circumnavigated to their quest’s origin. But they weren’t the only ones
doing work to achieve that goal. Selene, Zara, and Nomad had crossed even further
off the beaten path in much the same manner. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You
shouldn’t come back here.” Nomad’s mannerism implied his time with them was at
an end. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“If we get
lost again, you can just lend us another hand!” Selene was unconvinced. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I won’t be
here next time. Don’t come looking for me.” He dammed not to even turn and
address her directly. But Zara disagreed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Don’t be
silly, there’s no way the grimm will get the better of you. They can’t even get
the better of me and-“ </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><b><i>“Don’t
come back!”</i></b> He clenched his teeth. <i>“There’s nothing to be found
here.”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Sheesh,
fine.” Zara walked away. He waited for them both, allowing them to pass in
front of him. A couple steps and she was thrown into the familiar courtyard
with the aircraft. “Hey, we made it!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Nomad’s eyes
narrowed on the one visible students: <i>Lucifer. </i>Before anyone had a
chance to look over and see Nomad, he was already gone. A rapid draft was left
in his absence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Huh? Nomad?
W-Where did he go?” The zephyr provoked Selene into taking notice of his abrupt
disappearance. It didn’t matter, the rest of Team Lance’s arrival overshadowed
his abandonment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Selene!
You’re okay!” Alecto bounced up and down whilst Lucifer gave her a light
embrace. Nadia also unveiled her true form, pleased as anyone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What?
Where’s <i>my</i> recognition?” Zara pouted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Well to be
fair, <i>Nomad</i> did most of the work.” Selene tried to hold back her
amusement. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“He did <i>not!”</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Who’s this
‘<i>Nomad’ </i>fellow?” Nadia pondered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“He was just
here! You should have seen him! He was really tall, he had this cool jacket,
and he had these big antlers!” Selene hyped the colleague up. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Antlers!?</i>
He wasn’t in the White Fang, was he?” Lucifer tossed his gaze around, always
ready for an altercation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“The White
Fang!? No, no! He was one of the good guys!” Zara stuck up for him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Good</i>
guys?” Nadia held her arms, her insecurity shining.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Wait, the
White Fang is here?” Selene shuddered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Ugh.”</i>
Nadia trampled away towards the ship, a look of anger on her face. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Not anymore
they aren’t!” Alecto put her hands on her hips. “Extra credit, here we come!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Extra
credit? You’re telling me you figured out who put a stop to the grimm?” a
familiar accent hit the friends hard. <i>Professor Stam!</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The teacher
strutted into view with the rest of the teams. At long last, everyone was
together at the getaway vehicle. Nobody was even sure how long they’d been
frolicking in the monochrome hillsides, their tour guide included. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“The White
Fang, if you can believe it” Lucifer saw him to the airbus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I don’t
know for sure I can<i>… </i>The White Fang?<i> Here?”</i> His voice turned
rambunctious. “But your conviction is convincing, no surprise there, Mister
Virtus! I’ll take you for your word!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yes!”
Alecto celebrated too soon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Team Lance
will receive one extra point!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Eh, that’s
it?” Her disappointing was accompanied by a slouch. Zara and Selene tried not
to laugh. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Stam finally
checked his scroll, the clouds looking a little too dim for his liking. “What
time is it? Oh, we’ve been here longer than expected. Alright everyone, gather
around! After getting to see everyone’s fighting ability, I must say I am… <i>more</i>
than impressed! You lot are filled to the brim with potential, I can already
tell! What with my supervision, I’ll have you all conquering Remnant within the
year! Are there any questions? <i>No?!</i> Excellent! Come, students! We
mustn’t dilly-dally! <i>Beacon Academy awaits!”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>He sorted
them all into the bullhead and prepped for a launch. Not a single obstacle
stood in their way now, clearly just <i>getting</i> to the ship was challenging
enough of a task for one day. And what a day it had been. <i>Summit’s Blight</i>
brought with it horrible hailstorms of thunder, deafening hollers from mysterious
grimm, and a labyrinth full of enemies so baffling that the only escape seemed
to be found with pure luck. But perhaps the most puzzling of all it offered was
<b><i>Nomad</i></b>, the peculiar faunus who departed as soon as he had
arrived. </p>
