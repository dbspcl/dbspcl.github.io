    Sunrise, sunset, it mattered not. Lucifer was ready for anything, including
    the surprise wakeup from Nadia. She was up early. He didn’t even need to
    get involved this time. Nonetheless, he still did.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Welcome back to the land of the living.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Thanks? You’ve been practicing your wake up skills, haven’t you?” She rose
    from the sheets. “Turns out I don’t need you if I’ve got the sun on my
    side. One less burden for you... Not everyone sleeps in front of the
    window, though.” She pointed at the closet.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    "Maybe you two should switch places then. You’re far more pleasant to wake
    up than her.” Lucifer gave a faint laugh.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Not all of us can be early birds. Here, let <i>me</i> try waking her up.
    You’re certainly improving, I <i>think,</i> but I bet a pro would do the
    trick. M-Maybe then, I could contribute something. Oh, she left the door
    unlocked. Odd, she’s been really adamant about keeping this place to
    herself. Didn’t she just install the lock yesterday? Well, I think with
    some encouragement, she’ll break out of her shell. Take notes.” Nadia
    slipped through the closet door and closed it, not wanting any
    disturbances. Now alone, Lucifer shook head his back and forth at the sound
    of rapid commotion. The chaos taking place inside the wardrobe, if the
    noise was anything to go off of, couldn’t be matched.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Aha!”</i>
    The door sped open before being slammed shut. Nadia blocked it with her
    back, not that anybody could tell until her semblance was switched off.
    “She had a bad sleep!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Did she?” Lucifer found enjoyment in teasing the knight.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How about you? Sleeping in a chair like that probably isn’t good for your
    back.” Mid-sentence, Merlin hopped from under Selene’s bed onto Nadia’s,
    where she then picked him up for a petting session.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s none of your concern.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh. Sorry.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You apologize too much.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Team Lance’s resident princess left the bathroom to join the antics. “Good
    morning, Nadia!” Selene crashed on her bed, wherein the bunny returned to
    her.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You too. See, you should take lessons from <i>her. </i>That’s how you
    greet someone at dawn.” She bowed in Lucifer’s direction.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t go too hard on him! There’s not much for me to show Lucifer besides
how to kill ‘em with kindness! But he already knows how to kill, just with…    <i>guns.”</i> She shivered. “Still, it would be fun to try! The student
    becomes the master! That reminds me, Lucifer?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Braids?” He was smirking under the mask, knowing she could tell.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You know me too well.” Selene half skipped over and stood with her back
    facing him. He instinctively began braiding her hair in a very peculiar
    way- just to her liking.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What’ve you been up to? Have any fun stories? I wish I could have partaken
    in them myself, if I… I’ve just been busy, I-” Lucifer started.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s okay, really! I haven’t been doing much anyway, haha…” Her voice had
    an uneasy edge to it. Selene was pretty sure it wasn’t going to get past
    Lucifer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Really?</i>
    Why’s that?” His fingers moved with fervent precision, and while that was
    fairly common for him, there was an extra element of grace that remained
    absent in his fighting style. He was fast too, crafting perfect patterns
    out of her locks.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “N-No reason! I, um, I’ve just had lots of homework.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You and I share all our classes, we haven’t had much homework. What’s the
    real reason?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nothing…” She made the mistake of turning around, hoping it would embolden
    her conviction. But when Lucifer locked those red sockets on her, he knew
    she’d melt. “I-It’s Maximus!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Maximus?</i>
    The outcast with the <i>cards?”</i> His voice teemed with resentment.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah… He’s been bothering me. I-It’s nothing! I promise.” She posed back
    around so he could continue the braiding.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Selene.</i>
    Why didn’t you tell me?” He sighed, resuming his good work.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m sorry. I just didn’t want you to-“
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If Maximus does anything to you, call for me. Alright?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Yes.” The trio sat in silence until Selene rekindled the flames of
    discourse by <i>humming.</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I take it you’ve been honing your voice? And what of your dancing skills?
    You know, Nadia, Selene has <i>always</i> been gifted in such arts.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Really? How lucky. Coordination and a strong voice will contribute    <i>so</i> much to learning how to fight. At least, I know my attempts
    helped <i>me.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Selene’s face took on a crimson shade, but it didn’t last as her intricate
    braids were finished. Lucifer offered a gentle pat on the head. “There,
    there. You’re all done.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Thanks!” She turned and offered him a tight hug, one he gladly accepted.
    “What was all that racket earlier? I’d probably have stayed in there and
    done my hair myself, but as our best fighter I just <i>had</i> to make sure
    nothing crazy was afoot!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Okay, <i>‘best fighter.’ </i>Go in there and see for yourself.” Nadia
    giggled at the closet.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Don’t.”</i>
    Lucifer swooped in front of the entrance and crossed his arms. In saving
    her the touch of madness beyond the other side, he put himself dangerously
    out of position. Without provocation, the door blasted open with him in the
    crossfire.
    <i>
        “Argh!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Gah! What are you doing?” Alecto punctuated her entrance.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Standing.” He grunted. “I suppose I should have seen that coming. But
    you’re up. That means it’s time to leave. Professor Stam won’t be happy
    otherwise.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “But I just got here! How punctual with your time must you be?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m up first and early, I <i>leave</i> first and early.” He told them.
    Selene chuckled. “What little breathing room we have is sure to dry up.
    Keep insisting our arrival is left to the last moment though, and someday
    the deadline won’t be the only thing <i>dead.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So you’re telling me I’m going to <i>die</i> if I don’t leave early?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The hijinks never stopped, even as they waited patiently within Stam’s
    classroom. His lesson had <i>just</i> begun. “Alright, class! How are you
    all today? Good? <i>Great!</i> But it’s about to get even better. Our new
    short unit will be focused on one thing: <i>defense.</i> Learning to fight
    without taking a hit will prove invaluable, especially in the face of an
empty Aura meter. So instead of sparring Grimm, today we’ll be sparring    <i>each other.</i> Are there any volunteers? What about you, Miss Flora?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “M-Me?” Nadia said.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “But of course! Don’t think I didn’t see you hiding at the back table! Your
    skill would be much better placed here, at the front! What say you?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nadia, petrified with embarrassment, sulked in her seat. It was true- she
    had opted to sit behind Team Lance, out of a fear of being picked. She just
    hoped it didn’t make her more obvious.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Simply teasing, Miss Flora. For now. What about anyone else?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh! Me!” Alecto barked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No? <i>Fine,</i> I’ll be picking names out of this urn.” He didn’t give
    anyone time to raise their hand. “First challenger: Miss Keraseer!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yes!” She celebrated her supposed luck and walked downstage, high-fiving
    both Nadia and Selene.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Second challenger: Mister <i>Sirius!”</i> The next contestant joined her
    to shake hands. Alecto was unfamiliar with <i>Terrance Sirius</i> and his
    fighting style. The first thing to note were the feathers rooted in his
    hair. Stam laid down the law.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Now, evasion of attacks, regardless of method, is the main focus. But more
    importantly, the <i>consistency</i> of such practice is paramount!
    Therefore, the first person to be hit will lose the duel!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What!?” They both shouted, although Alecto had more to say on the matter.
    “When will there ever come a time I won’t have Aura!? It regenerates,
    doesn’t it?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Keep thinking like that, and it’s all the more likely to break in a fight.
    Not to worry- once a winner is determined, they will fight
    <i>
        me.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“You!?”</i>
    They spoke in unison once again. The class erupted with laughter.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s right! Now, fight!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Challenger <i>one</i> drew her sword, challenger <i>two</i> began
    channeling his semblance. Terrance flexed his fingers, electricity crawling
    from the nodes in his shoulder around his body, building up power. Alecto
    gulped, fearing a seemingly group based-attack was on its way. The shotgun
    approach would end the bout instantly, and now a <i>shockwave</i> of
    lightning exploded forth, covering the entire arena.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No!” Alecto used a strenuous technique to block the outburst, raising her
    blade to absorb every bolt of twitching voltage. By the near end of the
    assault, she couldn’t take anymore, flipping backward to thread around the
    remaining sparks.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Terrance needed to recharge, and in doing so Alecto was able to bridge
    their gap and show off <i>true</i> skill. A dance of blades inspired a
    great spectacle, but it proved ineffective. Terrance seemed to excel at
    semblance usage and evasion- <i>perfect</i> for this trial.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Each team rooted on their representative, tempting them to push their
    strikes a tad farther, their blades an inch closer, their semblances to the
    full brink of full potential. In doing this, both Alecto and Terrance made
    a terrible mistake, only at the
    <i>
        same time.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ah!” They both sprung back.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Truth be told, I didn’t see that one. I <i>blinked.</i> Class, who won
    that round?” Stam stood up. The two halves of the room chanted two
    different answers. “Alright, it’s a tie. Continue then!
    <i>
        Fight on!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hya!” Alecto sprang into action amidst the bedlam, slicing Terrance in the
    back, cementing her victory. The bird faunus whizzed away to the edge of
    the forum without refuge.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>“Darrgghh!</i></b>
    <i> Curse you, you cheating little wench- Aha,</i>
    I mean, you truly <i>are</i> a worthy opponent.” Up until Terrance cut
    himself off, his words and face were both fraught with unhinged anger. He
    flipped on a dime once he noticed all the attention he was garnering. “Good
    fight!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Uh, thanks?” She peered around in an awkward daze.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Alright, Miss Keraseer! That was a fine display, one worth of extra
    credit.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Haha!” She posed, savoring the applause. Terrance’s grumbles couldn’t be
    heard over the clapping nor his own footsteps. He didn’t look happy,
    either.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“And as an added bonus, you get to witness firsthand the workings of a    <i>true</i> Huntsmen! Don’t worry, we’re switching places! Just to
    demonstrate what we’re all striving to achieve, I will stand on the
    receiving end, and will not attack! You come at me with everything you’ve
    got, Miss Keraseer, and we’ll see the benefits of this defense-oriented
    unit!” He droned on. Alecto <i>thought</i> she understood the basic gist of
    it. Just attack, and then Stam will show everyone how to block.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Got it.” She paused then charged forward. Unfortunately Stam wouldn’t be
    using his weapon to exhibit what great combat prowess looked like, but what
    happened next was just as impressive. His monumental size didn’t matter, he
    shuffled around every thrust and swipe with ease. The power gap between one
    of the more capable students and an experienced Huntsmen was evident. Even
    so, Team Lance’s ambassador wouldn’t give in.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Very good, Miss Keraseer!” He moved faster without breaking a sweat. He
    had to cartwheel backward to keep it up though, now steering around the
    entire stadium to eventually land on the other side’s desk with a single
    bound, and with spare time to check his scroll no less.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ugh. He’s too fast!” Alecto broke into a sprint to catch him out.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Woah!” His arrogance would not be rewarded. Stam’s only option was to
    weave off the table into the battleground’s center, just as planned. Before
his jump had even finished, Alecto chucked her saber at a chain holding the    <i>chandelier.</i> Stam <i>could</i> avoid the plummeting piece of
    furniture, but that would require his full focus. So enamored with dodging
    it would anyone be that he walked right into Alecto’s trap.
    <i>
        Or so it would seem.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Gotcha!” She swung the sword down to finish the confrontation. Even with
    all the meticulous planning and exhausting speed, she missed by more than a
    hair. Stam grabbed her arm and prevented the stab without even looking at
    her.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Miss Keraseer. I stopped you, yes, but that was one of the most
    well-earned counters I’ve seen from a student in quite some time. Excellent
    work.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    She fell to her knees, using her sword to keep upright, completely drained
    from both fights. The audience felt it necessary to praise the combatant
    regardless. She fared better than most anyone else would, and thus she
    deserved the acclaimed cheers. “Th-Thank you, Professor.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You owe me a chandelier.” He sent her back to crowd.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You were amazing!” Selene whispered upon her arrival. Nadia gave some
    silent claps of encouragement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “She’s right. Better than I expected.” Lucifer nodded.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If that’s what it takes to get a compliment. Haha.” Alecto said. With the
    highlight of class out of the way, the rest of it whistled by without
warning. Next in line was the test ready to be offered by    <i>Augustus Correctional Facility.</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nadia had hurried out of class, only tending to the pleasantries of a
goodbye, and arrived at the prison in record time.    <i>East Wing, Sector Two-One-Four.</i> The pursued location was clear, and
    reached as easily as it was remembered.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The food here isn’t very good, is it?” Nadia grabbed a banana off a nearby
    cart.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I guess. Maybe it’s better in another section, but I… I don’t really eat
    anyway.” Ella walked with her.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s right. How was your night?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It was nice, but…”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Another nightmare?” Nadia looked away.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Yeah. I had an idea, though. Maybe if we use some equipment, we could
    figure out what they’re about. You know, since I… can’t really remember any
    of them.” Ella’s voice throbbed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We’ll find something out, I’m sure!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Augustus was caring to an incarcerated crook strapped into a wheelchair,
    juggling his wrestles and medical needs along with four other custodians.
    But once he caught sight of Nadia out the corner of his eye, he dropped
    everything. “You! Just what the doctor ordered. We could use your help.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Me? Uh, okay.” Nadia did a double take at his excitement. “What do you
    need?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Our staff and I have been looking into a recent influx of weapons the scum
    of this kingdom have accumulated. And we have our guesses, but they’re just
    that: <i>guessing.</i> I need an insider to investigate the one arming
    these thugs. He can’t be negotiated with.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m pretty good at stealth.” Nadia grinned. “I can <i>try</i> to help.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s not that simple, I’m afraid. The man producing these guns holds
    incredible power, and to confirm our suspicions we’ll need a factory new
    armament straight off the assembly line. Not only would this prove this
    arms-dealer <i>is</i> an arms-dealer, it might just give us the secret to
    his engineering, and therefore his
    <i>
        weakness.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Th-this is a lot to take in. So I need to-“
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Augustus pulled her aside and muttered his words to make sure they couldn’t
    be overheard. “Infiltrate <b><i>Servus Portum,</i></b> the city owned by
    the lord in question: <b><i>Caligula,</i></b> and capture a gun fresh off
the conveyer belt. But be warned, Servus Portum is more like a    <i>fifth </i>kingdom than any metropolis you or I know. Try to bypass the
    system, and you’re marked for death. Leaving is banned all the same<i>.</i>
    You must stay low, out of sight. I highly suggest you bring an ally,
    somebody with knowledge of military tech or firearms.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>Okay. Sneak into Servus Portum, steal a gun, and leave.</i>
    “<i>’Somebody with knowledge of military tech or firearms?’</i> I might
    have someone in mind. But couldn’t you go? Why send a first-year? I-I’m not
    sure I want to disappoint you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I can’t enter. It’s against orders. My master already has an informant in
    Servus Portum- but as of late, the Administrator’s been convinced to
    relocate him towards a set of mountains named <i>Terra Insanire.</i> None
    of that matters, presently. A rogue of your caliber should have no problem
    quitting if things get dicey, and I have a feeling they will. If you need
    help finding <i>Servus Portum,</i> look up. Follow the red skies.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I can only promise I’ll do my best. I-I’m sorry if I fail. Let’s go.”
    Nadia left to drop off her friend and endure the quest. Augustus resumed
    his detention of the confined criminal. The path back to the rehab center
    was too simple to get lost, but a detour through the <i>exclusive</i>
    vacant holding cells would hasten the trip.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So you have to leave already?” Ella wiped her face. “We still haven’t met
    your friends. They sound like a lot of fun, more so than this place.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’ll meet them as soon as possible, I promise! I wish I could stay and
    hang out, but good ol’ <i>‘Auggie’ </i>has a new mission for me. It’s too
    risky to take you along. Sorry.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-It’s okay. I’ve always wanted to know how to fight. Maybe you can teach
    me sometime, then I can come with you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Maybe you can teach <b>me</b> the same, Nadia!”</i>
    Dimitri slammed his hands on the iron bars as if his laughing didn’t
    already get their attention.
    <i>
        “Hehehehehe! I must say, this is one of the worst resorts I’ve ever had
        the displeasure of visiting- my room didn’t even get a view! What say
        you?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I say we’re leaving!” She grabbed Ella’s wrist.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Wh-Who are you?” Ella gasped.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>“Me!?</i></b>
    <i>
        What are you whacky? I’m Dimitri, the real deal, top of the charts! I
        pack tons, I rain heapin’ ones! I’m-“
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    Nadia finished the poem with a rather abrupt ending by leaving.
    <i>
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Hey, c’mon! I thought we had something special, you and I! You’re my
        elite! Here to do my bidding!”
    </i>
    He waved his arms through the slits in his cage. His cell was locked with a
    tight iron door, one that needed a slotted window for air to pass inside.
    Vents were too easily exploitable. His only glimpse into the outside world
    was under heavy guard, always being watched.
    <i>
“Keep playing coy and I’ll start to think you don’t like me. Ah well,        <b>see you soon…”</b>
    </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Sorry, I didn’t know he was there.” Nadia pitched a console attempt as
    soon as the maniac was left behind.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Y-You knew him?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m the reason he’s in here.” Her statement revealed all it needed to.
    “Anyway, I need to go before sundown! See you tomorrow!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh-Okay!” Ella tried to conclude their meeting with some level of friendly
    finality, but it was all for naught. Nadia was already long gone. “…Bye.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nadia gathered her team and travelled towards the flame-ridden skies, just
    as Augustus recommended.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Serve us, serve many!” A commanding voice echoed past the countryside.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m guessing one or more of those blimps are responsible for these
    one-liners.” Lucifer studied the outer walls of Servus Portum from a
    distance. “There seems to be no break in the borders save for those gears.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You want us to run in between those crushing cogs? Are you crazy?” Alecto
    could see the gears in question. The walls were huge, split into massive
    panels which were connected a spinning apparatus.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“I</i>
    don’t want you to. That’s the only way. Have a better idea, you’re welcome
    to try.” Lucifer lowered the binoculars and started a jog down the mountain
    towards the hellish capitol. Servus Portum was vast, easily recognizable
    from the silhouette of its infinite skyscrapers breaking through an orange
    haze. There was no rest from the clouds. Even the skies were infected with
    the bloody fog, courtesy of the blimp-battalion keeping watch.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Wait a minute. Is this thing moving? Wow.” Nadia identified a new concern
    as they finally settled within earshot of the boundary. Every section of
    the wall was mobile. Slowly but surely, the red city was inching to the
    east, travelling, <i>expanding.</i> And of course, the blimp’s loud
    speakers had resigned to keep spouting off catchphrases. The sheer volume
    gyrated the ground, and they weren’t even inside yet.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Our city welcomes you with open firearms!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Shut up.” Lucifer groaned. In order of team name, each of the three
    adventurers scaled the grooves to reach a mid-point with the etched wheel.
    “Where’s Nadia?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Over here! It’s easy guys! C’mon!” She had phased into existence on the
    other side. They paused then leapt between the swinging pinions without
    trouble. All that was left to do was slide down the metal exterior into the
    <i>
        Realm of Caligula.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Team Lance landed in the back alley between an amass of decrepit buildings.
    They all knew the briefing. To locate any number of the industrial
    foundries scattered throughout the territory was trivial.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We need to get <i>there.”</i> Lucifer gestured to a formation of chimneys
    sticking into the air amidst the crowded superstructures. Staying under the
    radar, they made decent ground. One thing they <i>couldn’t</i> avoid was a
    major road populated with soldiers and destitute civilians alike.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What should we do?” Alecto acknowledged their outlandish apparel. An
    epitome of military grandiosity, a scamp wearing the robes of a devoted
    disciple, and a duelist cloaked in glistening armor- all three toting
    capes.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How about this?” Nadia said. She passed around a load of tattered burlap
    cloth from a wheelbarrow. Now shielded in dilapidated shawls, they fit
    right in amongst the general public.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m guessing that’s Caligula?” Alecto asked. She needn’t not clarify.
    Everywhere awaited posters of the cretin. If <i>they</i> were anything to
    go off of, even if they embellished his appearance, the nominal ruler was a
    real specimen indeed. With every flyer came a message that read along the
    lines of <i>‘Welcome to Servus City,’</i> or
    <i>
        ‘The Drums of War Ring High.’
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Look up, see salvation”</i>
    The aircrafts commanded. Well, Nadia looked up, but that’s not quite what
    she would describe as
    <i>
        salvation.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re probably right, but I’m hoping you’re wrong.” Lucifer’s expectation
    of the impending inquisitor grew ever fiercer.

“Serve us, serve many.” A passing soldier chanted at the presumed peasants.    <i>No response.</i> Without reason, he ripped the closest one away by her
    shoulder.
    <i>
        “What did I just tell you!? Serve us, serve many.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ah! Um- Serve us, serve many!?” Nadia fumbled to find the words, half
    repeating his mantra and half hoping such an act would do the trick. Alecto
    contemplated intervening, but thought better of it, meanwhile Lucifer just
    turned to watch. He knew Nadia could squirm her way out of this, either
    with her words or semblance. The <i>Servus Sentry</i> let her go and went
    on his way. Through this, many details were diverged. It couldn’t be missed
    that every single warmonger looked completely identical as a clone marked
    by medals, and the same pointed hat. They even spoke in identical
    inflection. The gaps in regal clothing revealed a mechanical interior. The
    bionic voyagers, titled <i>Purifiers,</i> were not to be toyed with.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…You know I’d probably be a lot angrier about that if I wasn’t enjoying
    this music. Seriously, what’s the deal with the tunes?” Nadia asked. She
    wasn’t the only one to notice an android bolted atop a pedestal, replicated
    on every street corner. They all played the same instrumental band song.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m glad you’re enjoying it. Ugh, what I wouldn’t give to shut these
    things up.” Lucifer rolled his eyes. The morale boosting music did stop at
    that moment, but it was replaced with another endless stream of news
    straight from the blimps. “<i>Argh!</i> That’s even worse!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hey, at least we’re here. Sermon Atrium, huh?” Alecto looked up at a
    banner stuck to a massive complex topped with smoke stacks. The state’s
    iconic emblem was stamped above the door. Whatever they expected inside, it
    was dwarfed by the impressive size and multipurpose nature of the factory.
    They’d learn how this structure also served as a <i>huge</i> auditorium
    soon enough.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “There’s the guns! H-How are we going to get inside?” Nadia cupped her
    eyes, staring through a window into the automated workshop.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Every one of these windows is sealed, there’s no way inside from here. We
    need to find another way. Over here.” Lucifer tore his rags away, provoking
    the others to do the same. Marching the only path up a staircase didn’t
    bring good news, but rather the acute opposite. “Oh, fantastic.”
    <p>

    Team Lance found themselves among a gigantic assembly, surrounded by locals
    on the upper balcony of a great concert hall. And below on the far end
    domineered a true fiend indeed. Caligula stood against a podium, ranting.
    Guards stood everywhere, implying the arsenal of weaponry visible under his
    jacket wasn’t enough of a warning.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Make no mistake, the <i>Creatures of Grimm</i> will be decimated by the
    might of my armies. I will not stop. It will not be long until all of
    Remnant can say the same. You must make a sacrifice for your Supreme
    Leader! Our neighbors to the east, Vale, remain our ally. It is unfortunate
    of me to say, however, that their denizens and Atlas appose my great
    reign.” His voice was identical to the one held by the blimps.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Forget this nonsense.” Lucifer observed a doorway with a plaque implying
    its connection to their goal.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “They probably aren’t going to let you just walk in there as an outsider,
    but then again… You do <i>look</i> like a villain. Maybe you can fit right
    in.” Alecto suggested.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Just walk in there? Are you…” He thought for a moment. “Correct. Good
    work. Stay here, and I’ll return. At the sound of commotion, feel free to
    follow after me.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “This was supposed to be a stealth mission.” Nadia grimaced at his absence.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What have we been doing this entire time? Besides, he’s not going to get
    caught, he’s far too convincing.” Alecto whispered, noticing how a stray
    guard eyed her.

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The horde wouldn’t stop clapping, listening in but stirring as Caligula
    reached into his coat. They were relieved to learn all he presented was a
    cased bullet. “It is my understanding that, as a common ally against the
    Grimm, they’ve aligned with me in ceasing all resistance. It’s ever
    increasingly concerning, then, that they grow sullen at my insistence to
    purge Remnant of this plague. They want me to cease the <i>barriers.</i> To
    stop this <i>glorious</i> expansion. Nonetheless the procedure and this
    plan will continue unhindered.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’ve got it.” Lucifer returned, unable to show off the prize considering
    the watchful eyes of Caligula’s men.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “But do not forget the <i>Impure Menace.</i> The faunus have moved to
    Summit’s Blight, a cluster of mountains to the south. Remember, the White
    Fang stands in complete opposition to my cause, as any attempts to breach
    the Blight has been met with nothing but missing infantry.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I already hate this guy.” Nadia sighed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Why? Because he wants to crush the scoundrels within the    <i>White Fang?</i> These faunus are in a league of their own. There’s
    plenty to despise Caligula over, but his ambitions against our enemy isn’t
    one of them.” Lucifer scoffed.

</p>

    <i>“Our</i>

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The enemy of my enemy is… <i>still</i> my enemy.” Lucifer admitted.
    “Nothing but enemies, all of them. And they’ll be treated as such.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Unbelievable. The White Fang <i>isn’t</i> an insane cult of madmen,
    they’ve simply strayed from the cause!”

</p>
<p>
    <p>

<p>
    <b><i>“What are you doing?”</i></b>
    A sentinel wrenched her arm away, screaming.
    <i>
        “Falsifying an enemy of the state, and defamation of a Servus Official?
        On your knees, <b>now.” </b>

    “You!” Another Purifier hustled out of the laboratory, pointing at the
group.    <i>“There is no tolerance of theft concerning Servus Portum property!” </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer wasn’t going to tolerate the commands aimed at his colleagues or
    himself, already wound up from the argument. He swung, catching the officer
    off guard as his appearance hinted at an alliance. A member of the trained
    ordinance wouldn’t have been taken out that easily though, and soon others
    had involved themselves, taking on the three friends.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Pay little attention to the hubris presented in the gallery, let them
    instead remain an example, a lesson to all who attempt a defense of the
    White Fang, and its allies.” Caligula droned on.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto contemplated sitting back, understanding the consequences of joining
    this act of open aggression towards Servus Portum. But a team’s a team. She
    jumped in without regard for her enemy’s safety. The skirmish went well,
    that was, until several observing cadets realized they weren’t dealing with
    untrained transients, but experienced travelers. Nadia swerved around to
    impale the militants. Lucifer fired upon them, disinterested in whatever
    harm fell upon the citizens. And Alecto proved her worth as a gladiator in
    full.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The patrons of my great city will not be triumphed by a traitor nor a band
    of cohorts. We live and die by sword and gun without question. It is the
    highest honor to perish in the heat of battle. Heed my words, lest you all
    meet a similar fate!” Caligula unsheathed a cutlass and raised it high in
    the air, prompting a roar of commendation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Enough of this mindless drivel</i>
    .” Lucifer’s sickly omen made his intentions clear. Perhaps Nadia should
    have deliberated a different ally, unless she <i>wanted</i> to bring an
    easily angered mercenary willing to shove the entire operation off track.
    With a flip away from an approaching henchmen, Lucifer whipped out the
    classic sniper and took aim mid-vault.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The bullet smeared through the air into Caligula’s forehead, splitting his
    Aura and blowing him backward onto the floor, ostensibly killing him in an
    instant.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“What!?</i>
    Are you insane? We just had to take the evidence and leave! You were
    supposed to <i>help</i> me!” Nadia took advantage of everyone’s panic to
    scold Lucifer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I just did.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Hahahaha!”</i>
    Caligula rose to his feet. “An attempt on my life is but a perfect
    opportunity to show how little this resistance matters. Do you see now? I
    cannot be killed. I am untouchable!” out of his suit came a mini-gun
    magnificent enough to put all others in their place.
    <i>
“And <b>this</b> is a welcome opportunity to teach some        <b>respect!” </b>
    </i>
    <b>
        <p>
        </p>
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
The pure power of the weapon tore through seats, wood scaffolding, and    <i>urbans</i> like butter. Even his own men weren’t exempt from his wrath.
    In Caligula’s eyes, the situation wouldn’t have devolved this far if they
    were doing their job to begin with. Beacon Academy’s proxies dove for cover
    before scrambling out of sight down the stairs. Now in full lockdown mode,
    every exit in the building was replaced with a shutting vault door.
    Everyone but Alecto made it out safely.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ah! W-Wait! My cape!” The article of clothing had been caught in the
    closed gate, clotheslining her to the ground.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Just take it off! C’mon!” Lucifer and Nadia were already several yards
    away, unaware of her plight.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No! I can’t let it go!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What are you talking about!? Take it off!” Lucifer had already ran over
    despite his complaints. It took a great amount of strength but he
    eventually budged the aperture an inch, and Alecto ran to freedom.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A few street corners later and they were out of the woods. “Stop right
    there!” <i>Not quite. </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’ll meet up with you on the outside. I wouldn’t want to slow you down.”
    Nadia gave one hint as to her intentions then vanished. <i>She</i> might be
    able to walk away, but troops were everywhere, ready to close in on the
    remaining two.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “There’s too many of them, we’ll never make it out of here with brute
    force.” Lucifer comprehended the impossibility of fighting hundreds of
    trained recruits in the depths of their own territory. The city’s main
    entryway was out of the question. It must’ve been teeming with
    reinforcements by now. Their only way out being the same passage they
    entered with.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The back street they’d ventured through earlier was clogged by blocks of
    minions that could be evaded, but regarding the incoming gunfire all that
    could be done was <i>hope</i> they miss. They weren’t very lucky. Finally,
    the temporary shelter of a renegade alleyway harbored them.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “This is insane. I didn’t sign up for this. We might have fared better if
    we brought more people.” Alecto cracked up halfway through, savoring the
    stupidity of it all.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Like who? <i>Zara?</i> As a faunus, she’d have been gunned down the second
    she stepped foot on this soil. Even Atlas would treat her better. And
    there’s not a chance I’d have brought Selene here.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Who am I kidding, we’re the best warriors in these parts! I could take on
    any of these nitwits in a joust.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “They’re not going to fight you in a <i>‘joust,’</i> you fool. Strength in
    numbers. That’s the age old adage of <i>war.”</i> Lucifer hurried along,
    sensing an enclosure of the area. A tour up the moving wall stood in their
    way, challenging each of them to tackle the sheer climb in whatever manner
    suited them. One of them used their ancient sword to gain purchase on the
    metal, the other a combat knife.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    One brisk maneuver through the gears and down the shiny dam, and they ran
    right into <i>Nadia.</i> She had finally figured exposing herself early
    would prevent a collision.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Good. We’ve made it. That’s what counts. I hope this was worth it, after
    all that.” Lucifer held the gun up, investigating what made it so valuable.
    “Good craftsmanship and dust mileage. You said Warden Augustus needed it?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s right. With this, we can test Caligula’s innocence. Hard to believe
    a guy like that could gain anything from distributing weapons. Anyway, I’ll
    take this back for further analysis.” Nadia took it.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We should probably leave before more of those goons find us.” Alecto was
    justifiably paranoid. They hit the road without another word, galloping
    across the dead landscape away from Servus Portum. It was far easier to
    breath without the trademark pollution.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    As they took their leave, however, a batch of less idealistic daredevils
    replaced them. Caligula and his enthusiasts walked outside the confines of
    the city, the immeasurable barricade <i>lifting</i> for them.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Not to worry, Supreme Leader. The Purifiers will send them with the rest.”
    One of the duplicates hoisted his automated hand, commanding a rifleman of
    indistinguishable appearance to raise his reticle towards the ant-sized
    detractors disappearing into the horizon. The legion could use guns, but
    their arms could also slide back and transform into nasty looking
    multi-barrel cannons. Another hand blocked him from firing upon the
    targets.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “I think not. No need to fret now my comrades, their time will come.”
    </i>
    Caligula smirked, holding a sniper’s bullet into view.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You killed seven of us on that balcony.” The grunt giving orders crossed
    his arms.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Had they done their job, I wouldn’t have taken a bullet to the forehead,
    General. A bullet, might I add, from Atlas’s best.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We could never anticipate this. You know that. We <i>won’t</i> be beat a
    second time, at least not like that. And by all means, continue your
    crusade against us. If you do, that <i>won’t</i> happen again.” Aamon laid
    a hand on Caligula’s back and paced everyone into Servus Portum.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Do me this favor, General. Line the border with purifiers.” Caligula made
    sure such a catastrophe would be impossible to replicate.

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    By the time our heroes had made it back to Vale, the sun had set. Nadia was
    long gone at Augustus Correctional while Lucifer and Alecto finally
    returned to the courtyard of Beacon.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>

    “That didn’t take so long.” Alecto stretched upon landing.

    <p>

    “An exuberant amount of time. It was painful… but fun.” He had to admit the
    spice of a good adventure couldn’t be knocked.

</p>
<p>
    <p>

    “Finally, you lightened up a little bit. And look what it took. I almost

    </i>

    <p>

<p>
    “Almost.” He muttered, watching her frolic off to the library. While the
    dorms were enticing, the onset of strife near Beacon’s emblematic statue
    bewitched the conscript.
    <p>

    “I really don’t have a clue what you’re going on about when you bring up
    this blackmail stuff! It’s <i>not.</i> It’s just a voluntary transaction of

    “I-I don’t have any lien! Please, I didn’t do anything to you.” Selene
    sulked. Merlin inched forward, showing his teeth.

    <i>“Ew, rabid tiny freaks…</i>
    That won’t fly, duchess. Someone of your caliber just <i>has</i> to be

    plucked her tiara away. She gasped in a panic, trying frantically to
    retrieve the accessory.
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    <p>

    A pair of hands ripped the bully away, pulling him in by his vest with both
    hands. Lucifer slammed him against the foundations of the campus’s statue.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ack! Who in the blue blazes!?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “I see you go near her again and I’ll break that smug little face in
        two!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Let the witch talk!’ Maximus slithered out of his grasp to head-butt the
    new competitor. It hurt thanks to the alloy target, but it worked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Lucifer!” Selene dusted off her dress, picked the tiara off the ground,
    and stumbled out of the blast zone. The scuffle showed no signs of ending,
    Lucifer pummeling the showman but receiving equal treatment.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Aha! Got an ace up my sleeve!” Maximus somersaulted down the path and
    reached forward. A line of <i>playing cards</i> drifted through the air
    into the commando, mowing him down. Another salute and they funneled around
    Lucifer, forming a twister of disorienting paper. It worked for only a
    couple seconds<i>.</i> Lucifer sped out of the whirlwind with the
    dependable knife just in time to be parried by a <i>magic wand.</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Pathetic, and weak!” He snarled, inciting a tango of blades and blunt
    clubs. Disregarding the staff, there were literally <i>clubs</i> being sent
    out every couple seconds, the cards doing their job of forcing either
    evasion or Aura loss. As it turned out, Maximus had no shortage of
    gimmicks, using the wand’s end to spout clumps of dust-powered flames.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Stop you two! You’re going to hurt somebody!” Selene watched in horror.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Frustrated and with Aura to spare, Lucifer <i>tanked</i> the attack and
    rushed through full force. Beacon’s stone path cracked when its best
    gagster was thrown onto his back. He wasn’t concerned at all though,
    flipping around and handing Lucifer a brutal reminder of the advantages
    that came with <i>kick-based</i> fighting.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“A real showstopper!”</i>
    Maximus decided it was time for another strategy, tossing them around with
    mindless zeal. Holding the open end of his top hat forward unleashed a
    tsunami of cards. Volleys of thick flimsy power were dispatched without
    end, forming a constant stream of raw energy. With this, he prevailed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer eventually worked his way around the snake-like discharge and ended
    the fight with an underestimated hit to the face, and a shotgun burst to
    the chest.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Okay, okay, you beat me!” Maximus kneeled off of the floor, wiping his
    eyes and mocking everyone by pretending to cry. It was clear he had plenty
    more to give. Lucifer paid no attention, grabbing Selene by the wrist and
    leaving before anymore havoc ensued.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hey! You didn’t have to fight him like that! Let me go!” She tried to
    escape his grip.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “No.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re embarrassing me! We’re not in Atlas anymore, you don’t have to act
    like this!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Enough. We’re leaving.”</i>
    Lucifer glanced away to address her directly, still moving forward.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“I’m ordering you to <b>let me go!</b> You’re hurting me!”</i>
    Her cries were finally addressed, but not by Lucifer. <i>He</i> ran right
    into
    <i>
        Professor Stam.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“What are you doing!?” </i>
    He had watched the entire mess.
    <i>
        “Virtus! Maximus! What is the meaning of this!?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Professor Stam! I-um, this is just…“ Maximus didn’t have anything witty to
    say <i>this</i> time.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Enough! I will <b>not</b> tolerate any of these antics on school
        grounds! You are <b>not</b> children, you <b>will</b> show respect to
        yourselves and others, as they have done to you! I will not…”
    </i>
    Stam paused and took a deep breath, straightening his posture. “I will not
    have it any other way. You two, follow me. Now.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer followed without question, showing only obedience. Maximus did the
    same, but couldn’t resist a petty groan. A few minutes passed, and suddenly
    they found themselves in Stam’s classroom, enduring the ends of a rather
    short but punctual lecture.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I would like to apologize for losing my temper. Mister Maximus, there’s no
    question in my mind you were terrorizing that young girl. Don’t let me find
    you repeating such an atrocity. And Mister Virtus, I understand your
    intentions, but this was not the correct way to solve your grievances. In
    future, I expect you to keep your composure. It’s a skill that’ll only
    benefit you, especially in battle. You two are promising students… Don’t
    let this rift grow any bigger.” Stam put out his verdict. The head of
    Beacon Academy joined the discussion, entering from behind.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Perhaps you two can learn from this. Disagreements are common. I trust
    from this little incident you’ll handle the next one in a more reputable
    manner. Even though it pains me to see students divided, I must admit, you
    both showed considerable fighting ability that scuffle.” Ozpin chuckled.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You heard Headmaster Ozpin. You two can leave. Now would be a good time to
    bed down.” Stam declared.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Maximus left immediately, leaving Lucifer behind. He stood out of his
    chair. “My apologies, Headmaster.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No need for that. It’s an honor to have you, as well as Selene, in my
    school. I think it’s about time we work on <i>her</i> semblance. It’s for
    the best she doesn’t have rely on <i>you</i> whenever she’s in trouble.
    There’ll come a time where you won’t always be there.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…I understand.” He left Stam’s classroom. The moon and its pieces gazed
    upon his exit. Once outside, he turned to see Selene approach. They cradled
    each other.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Did you get in trouble?” She asked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You could say that. They went pretty easy on me, all things considered.”
    He pulled back his mask as he often did talking to just Selene.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Haha. Thanks for helping me. Next time, just try talking things out first,
    okay?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You were always a better diplomat than me.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Just try.” She led him back to the dorm rooms.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I will.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    So it seems that, despite the disasters of Servus Portum and setbacks given
    by Beacon’s own pupils, Team Lance made it out in one piece. With luck this
    would persist for the remainder of the semester.
