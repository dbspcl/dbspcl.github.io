<p>
    “I don’t necessarily <i>need</i> your help, guys. I have allies inside, I
    already told you.” Zara proclaimed. On the outermost rim of Servus Portum,
    she hid alongside Nero and Maximus. They’d camped out overnight, waiting
    for the moving city to pass. And once it did, they approached from behind,
    towards an outpost of Purifiers.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh yeah? What sort of ally in there could <i>possibly</i> replace my
    dashing looks and dynamic appeal?” Maximus held a proud hand to his neck.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hush!” Nero stood in front of Zara to ensure any incoming fire was
    expended in vain. “You payin’ this <i>‘ally’</i> or whatever? I betcha my
    rates are <b>far</b> superior. Plus, if the tip’s nice, I’ll throw in a
    dust crystal imported straight from <i>Vacuo, East Sanus.</i> Cash only.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Any other plastic watches or broken compasses you’d like to peddle with
    that?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well, for frequent customers, I usually offer a free sticker for
    three-hundred credits.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
Zara had no choice but to address <i>that.</i> “Sweet. A    <i>free three-hundred credit sticker.</i> You must be a saint.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The devil on your shoulder, more like. Sure can’t resist my prices? If
money makes the world go round, <i>my</i> world’s a…    <i>spinning top, or a, um, ball on my finger?</i> S-Something that spins a
    lot, is my point. So let’s get this over quick. As you can see, that robot
ahead is training his cute little arm-guns at me. Should I kill him    <i>before</i> or <i>after</i> I check his pockets?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He’s only about to fire because he can’t see <i>me.</i> Move it!” Zara
    stepped out from her living shield, causing an immediate response from
    Aamon. Every Purifier stood down. That didn’t prevent Nero from caving
    their heads in with his flail. “Wait! Stop!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Not needed. For once, the last Purifier <i>grabbed</i> the chains, and
    flipped Nero onto his back. “W-What!? How did you manage that? Gah!” He
    tried again, only to be humiliated in much the same way. Maximus laughed,
    while Zara was fascinated to see the learning ability of Aamon firsthand.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Real nice backup you brought in, Zara. Can’t even kill a <i>droid.”</i>
    Maximus chided.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Explain to me, how a peasant- <i>yes, a peasant!</i> How one of the    <i>weakest,</i> most common grunts in Remnant can cancel my strikes with
its <b>stick</b> arms-” Again, Nero found himself on his back.    <b><i>“Just</i></b><i> like that! <b>Peasant!”</b></i>
    <b>
        <p>
        </p>
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Dude, he evolved from your last engagement. Just use something new. Kick
    him in the head, or something. Or actually, I have a better idea.” Zara
    quelled the disgusting display. “Could you stop crushing the Purifiers? Bit
    of a <i>vile</i> move. How about you <i>stop </i>that? All you’re doing is
    feeding him strategies. He’s on our side, anyway.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Is he now?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t believe me? Just ask him. He can’t lie.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Are you with us?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I have a companionship with Zara. If you are with <i>her,</i> then you and
    I have <i>never</i> been enemies. Since you’re here, it’s clear Zara has
    business inside Servus Portum. She was wise to come to <i>me.</i> I will
    not be able to accompany you in the city, but it is well within my limits
    to grant you entry.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m supposed to go to the <i>Bone Graveyard,</i> right?” Zara said.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yes. The excavation site near the center of Servus Portum. It is the area
    with the <i>least</i> manmade pollution. Seek out <b>my</b> blimp, above
    it. It is the one ship tethered to the ground. Now, Aamon requests that you
    kill me.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Normally you’d have to <i>pay</i> for my services, but consider this one
    on the house!” Nero swung down only to be intercepted. “Hey! Do you want a
    swift death, or not?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Instinct dictates otherwise. You must do away with me in a manner I have
    not seen, otherwise reflex will kick in. I suggest holding me under the
    wheels of this wall. In fact, I can do that myself. Aamon has never
    considered adapting to his <b>own</b> attacks. <i>This</i> might be an
    interesting experiment. Good luck.” The Purifier willingly walked to his
    death, being squashed under the border he was born to protect. It was an
    unwholesome, gruesome way to make an exit.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So, umm. Anyone want to explain what just happened?” Maximus fixed his
    insensible haircut. “Why did that chump just kill himself?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He’s only one of an army I couldn’t even begin to describe.” While they
    used the network of wallowed streets to make good ground, Zara supplied a
    much needed briefing on everything she and Team Lance gathered since
    initiation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Okay, okay. I get it. Dictators, wars, and enslavement. What about that
    cyborg-” He was rudely interrupted by the very thing he’d been trying to
    understand: another Purifier. “Yeah, him! What’s your deal this time? Not
    some sort of triple-agent, are you?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No. I’m here to tell you that if you continue, you’ll be caught on
    surveillance cameras hidden everywhere. Since your last stunt here,
    Caligula has improved security.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Too bad for him, he has <i>you</i> operating the system.” Zara snickered.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Too bad indeed. You must wear these robes to conceal your identity. You
    will blend in with the other Servants.” Aamon removed his three layers of
    hoods and wrapped one around each before leaving. “This time, I’d prefer
    our infiltration to stay under wraps. If you start another riot, security
will come down even harder. I suggest staying near the    <i>Choir Battalion.</i> If you do, their instrumentation will drown out
    your voices if you try to speak. Now is your chance. Their path will take
    you straight to the Bone Graveyard. Be wary.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ugh. This thing smells <i>horrible.”</i> Zara recoiled, unable to escape
    the stench nor scratchy surface. “C’mon. I can see Aamon’s ship from here.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Can this music, like, chill?” Maximus plugged both his ears with his
    fingers. “Real fun idea, Aamon. Standing two feet from ear damage
    incarnate.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “At least they play <i>good</i> music. I can’t imagine why, though. Does
    Caligula really think he can swindle the entire population if he gives them
    something to <i>listen</i> to? I-I guess he hasn’t failed, <i>yet.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He’d be better served hedging his bets against <i>me.</i> Come to think of
    it, most of the people in this dump could do with a game of cards. Maybe
    then, they can finally get some lien for a bite to eat.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ha.” Nero checked the time. “They want <i>money,</i> they need to play the
    game of voluntary transaction. Supply and demand, as the case may be. Then
    again, that might be a challenge even for <i>me</i> if <b>one</b> man
    controls all the means of production. Are monopolies outlawed here?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Everything</i>
    is outlawed here.” Zara sighed. Maximus added onto that.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Except obedience. That comes in
    <i>
        spades.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hey, I don’t think we’re supposed to keep following them! We’re about to
    turn away from Aamon’s ship. Quick, hide under here until they pass!” After
    checking the area to make sure there were no statues or propaganda to watch
    them, a stray barrow of sand proved the ideal hiding spot. There was an
unforeseen complication though, as none expected someone to start    <i>pushing</i> the cart.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Pssst! Who’s doing that?” Nero was impressed there was someone who could
    handle his size, not to mention the weight of the other two.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Maximus was quick to panic, even if he couldn’t unveil his position. “I
    knew this was a bad idea! This is all <i>your</i> fault, Zara!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hey! Look, we’ll probably be fine. It might just be some farmer, or
    something. Once we stop, we’ll wait, listen, and- Ah!” The whole bucket was
    turned over, though once everyone rubbed sand out of their eyes, the
    supposed farmer couldn’t be seen. More puzzling, if a welcome surprise, was
    their location. Directly under the target blimp, the Bone Graveyard was a
    sad collection of tombstones and rusted fences. Contrary to everything Zara
would’ve expected from the center of Servus Portum, the thick fog was    <i>blue,</i> and much less intrusive. It still formed a cloud to drown out
    sky. “So <i>this</i> is where we’re wanted. One of the Purifiers must’ve
    brought us here.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Before I step forward, I will not ask you to lower your weapons. But I
        need a promise you’ll not attack.”
    </i>
    A deal, most likely from Aamon, closed in from every direction.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “W-We won’t as long as you don’t. Right guys?” Zara forced compliance out
    of Nero and Maximus. Only then did two red pinholes cut through the
    darkness.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>

</p>

    question.

        Cherish it.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’d rather curse it. I never asked for this.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
Zara examined her weapons shamefully, while Aamon looked over his metal    <i>exterior.</i> <i>“…Neither did I.</i> You and your friends should follow
    me. It’s time I showed you something.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    After a brief interchange in which Zara quelled the worries of her unneeded
    guards, all four began a hike through the muddy ruins. Occasionally another
    Purifier would walk past them, programmed to repeat the classic mantra of
    Servants. “Serve us, serve many. Now, Zara. Pay attention. This isn’t
    something many people <i>ever</i> get to see. There is something inside
    this dead place, in the middle. Although I cannot anticipate why, Caligula
    has gone to great lengths to keep its existence a secret.” He abruptly
    stopped at the sight of <i>Victor,</i> and hid. Against all probability, he
    was here too, searching for something.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What’s he doing here?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “I cannot anticipate. Be quiet.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What’s he looking for?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “I cannot anticipate. Be quiet.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    It quickly became clear that Victor was in the midst of interrogating one
    of the soldiers. This was more than enough to cause Aamon grief. “Zara. You
    must take control! Speak for me, quick. I cannot lie, but <i>you</i> can.”
    He detached a number of wires, ripping out his core.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What’s the matter with you!?” She gagged.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Rip out my voice box, and speak for me. You’re connected to Aamon    <i>‘CB3406’</i> and you are to tell Victor I am not betraying him. What are
    you staring at? It’s just electronics. <i>Proceed!”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“I got this!”</i>
    Nero swiped the innards away and began an impressive impersonation. “Ahem.
    Yes, Victor? What do you need?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I just <i>told</i> you. Why are there so many Purifiers here?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, don’t worry about it. Nothing more than a routine search, ya know? To
    weed out any unsuspecting…
    <i>
        Detractors.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Right.” There wasn’t much to be gained from asking anything more, Victor
    thought to himself. Since deception was without possibility, not even his
    semblance needed to be employed. “What’s wrong with your voice? You don’t
    sound yourself.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nero had years of training, fit to attain the perfect poker face. “Caligula’s testing
    is to blame. His experimentation on augmented speech has left me worse for
    wear.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s <i>Supreme</i> Leader Caligula.” Victor scolded.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “O-Of course. Another product of his investigation.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Well, then.”</i>
    Victor trekked away, his arms folded.
    <i>
        “I will definitely need to ask him why he’s interfering with my work…”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’ll do, <i>for now.”</i> Aamon stretched his neck after stuffing the
    mechanical organism back behind a maze of plating and medals. “The good
    news is, we’re here. Just over this hill. I will let this speak for
    itself.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Just over the ridge awaited what would’ve been a breathtaking landscape.
    What held the view back was the presence of a massive <i>mine</i> down
    below. Not manmade by any matter of means, this ginormous hole was a silo
    of horns and mucus. In the deepest reach of the pit, which was too far to
    determine its depth, even the <i>wind</i> was polluted with black
    particles.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh my god… What <i>is</i> that?” Zara, in addition to Maximus and Nero,
    made clear the gross volume of the Bone Graveyard’s secret.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Aamon laid both hands behind his back. “We are in the middle of Servus
    Portum, <i>directly</i> in the middle. And <i>this</i> is the Grimm Core.
    There is dangerous truth to Remnant, and consider this the source. It is a
    chasm where everything is Grimm. Even the air.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So it’s a Grimm base?” Maximus deduced.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Rivaled by few, it seems. And known by few. Caligula has attempted to hide
    its existence from even me. That’s what’s most concerning about it. Look.”
    Aamon set his finger on the floor, setting a reference point. Within
    seconds, the cracked sludge of the Grimm Core had reached him with the same
    speed as the outer walls.
    <i>
        “The <b>Grimm Core</b> is expanding. The <b>Infection</b> is spreading.
    </i>
    Anticipate why.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What do you expect <i>us</i> to figure out? I’ve never seen anything like
    it. A Grimm outpost that naturally expands? It gets <i>bigger</i> with
    every passing day? The idea is ridiculous. You’re telling me you can’t
    figure out a way to stop it?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Wait.” Zara scratched her horns inquisitively. “You say Caligula wants to
    make sure no one figures out about it? Of course! He’s trying to run away.
He isn’t broadening his city for <i>greed.</i> He’s doing it to escape    <i>this!”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “To what end?” Nero watched as first a dandelion, then one of his spiked
    flail pieces were enveloped by the Grimm Core. “Ugh! Get off! Okay, I see
why you’d want to run. But what’s the end goal? Keep moving until    <b>all</b> of Remnant is occupied? And then what? <i>Die</i> to the
    Infection? He can’t be that insane.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Whatever he’s after, it must have to do with the eradication of this
    thing. Maybe that’s why he wanted Ella so.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “This doesn’t make any sense.” Aamon wasn’t free to form any theory of his own,
but he could shoot down plenty with ease.    <i>“Caligula is not a good man.</i> He himself was corrupted by the
    Infection years ago. He would never aid its demise.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What’s down there, anyway? Are there Grimm in the center?” Zara asked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Down there? In the center? That is the shortcut to Terra-Insanire.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “What!?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yes. It seems <i>that</i> place is immune to the Infection. Many ships
    were lost in trying to enter the vicinity of Terra Insanire due to poor
    visibility, and the presence of cloud-high cliffs. So the key is an
    underground path through the Grimm Core, which I had found by accident
    while investigating the state of this mess.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well what are we waiting for!?” Nero swung his weapon onto his shoulder,
excitement pushing him to take action. “Better late than never!    <i>C’mon! Team Lance and Blazer needs us!” </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Boreas</i>
    and <i>Terrance,</i> too!” Maximus spin his staff around gleefully.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Go if you must. There is nothing to fear down there but ghastly
    conditions.” Aamon waved them away. “You may take my men if you please, but
    I cannot come in person, Zara. If any of the Purifiers die, it only gives
me another well-earned set of immunities. But if any harm falls upon    <i>myself,</i> it is over. Good luck.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Thank you, Aamon. I won’t forget this.” She shook his hand before bolting
    downward, two Purifiers joining the charge. She was beginning to fear she’d
    never again see her old friends, nor the cryptic mountains in which they
    resided.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>Alecto</i>
    and <i>Beleth</i> stared each other down from many trenches away. It wasn’t
    uncivilized, but instead calm- both deduced the other to have been
    preparing, <i>waiting.</i> The fight was inevitable regardless. Beleth was
    standing tall, watching to make sure Alecto, as well as her absent
    assistant, didn’t try anything. Alecto, by comparison, sat cross-legged, a
    sword cradled in her arms. A far cry from the bloodthirsty hunter-persona
    she’d built up. Perhaps she was tempting the first attack.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“You know, it didn’t have to be this way.”</i>
    He called across the grimy scape of dirt and rock, exasperated.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “But I vowed to rid this world of Delphics. Outside of that, it is the duty
    of a Keraseer. I hope you can understand in this life, or the next.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I <b>don’t</b> understand. Whatever happened to you in the past, I’m truly
    sorry, but it had nothing to do with me. <i>Can’t you see that?”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “All I’ve known is the dark side of Delphics. I’m not sure there <i>is</i>
    any other side.” She jumped to her legs, and held her weapon out.
    “Remember. If your blindfold hadn’t slipped off, we’d all still think you
were a <i>faunus-</i> a pure soul, with a passion for the violin. And I… I    <b>trusted</b> you!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I couldn’t tell <i>anyone.</i> It wasn’t personal. I had no choice!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Stop.”</i>
    An expected interloper pulled himself up from a natural well.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Step aside, Lucifer.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “This is not happening right now. You’re <i>not</i> going to fight each
    other. Everybody, just <i>calm down.”</i> He looked over, startled in a
    twist of events at the energetic bounds of Lexy.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nope!” She held her finger out. “You’re not to get involved in this. Not
    again. Don’t you remember last time?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ha. It’s a bit of a blur. I think I might’ve hit my head. Can’t imagine
    why, though. I’m not joking around this time- there will be no fight
    today.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Then why not leave? If you go, I will too.” She brandished the fire-wheel
    like a fiend.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Negative.”</i>
    His refusal was blatant. Through all this, Alecto had zero reaction. Ever
    since her outpour to Team Lance, she’d been a lot more <i>focused. </i>
    Unbeknownst to her or anyone really, <i>Rade</i> wasn’t far.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    When Lexy threw her flaming roller, Lucifer <i>intercepted</i> it. And
    mostly due to inherent frustration, he pulled such that her neck was soon
    caught in his hand. So it was that despite his greatest efforts since the
    rivalry began, Lucifer acted as the catalyst for the final fight.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Rade jigged into view, twiddling his thumbs. “Oh, <i>Lucy.</i> I was hoping
    we could save our rematch for the Vytal Festival, <i>but…</i> A team’s a
    team! If it means keeping <i>you</i> out of this, I’d be happy to stall!
    Have at thee!”
    <i>
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No! But who will protect <i>Alecto?!”</i> He contested in vain, being
    tackled by the flimsy assault.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“I need no protection!” </i>
    She belatedly swung forward, sheer decisive dedication being the means of
    her hidden power. Lexy’s expertise and Beleth’s violin were hardly able to
    break her composure, both of them just trying to
    <i>
        survive.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The immeasurable pinnacle of stealth and false pretense had phased into
    existence, and now Alecto had <i>Nadia</i> to deal with as well. “Alecto,
    stop! <i>Please!</i> No more! It’s going to be alright!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This surprised Beleth more so than anyone else. “Nadia!? W-Why? Why are you
    with <b>us?”</b> His screaming didn’t last. He was abruptly cut off as the
    floor cracked, a <i>second</i> knight far more concerning than the first
    hastily descending from the stars. <i>Eleanor.</i> “...<i>Goodbye!”</i> He
    sprinted away.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Get him, Lady Eleanor!” Alecto said, her hands full with Lexy, being
    careful not to deny Nadia, but conveniently ignore her. She did her upmost
    to make sure her teammate wouldn’t be the victim of her own rage.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“It will be done.” </i>
    Eleanor swooped past them.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “L-Lexy! I will go protect Beleth! <i>Promise me</i> you won’t hurt
    Alecto!” Nadia didn’t receive a response, but she <i>had</i> to leave. She
    couldn’t even <i>begin</i> to track Eleanor down. Not when the wrestling
    match between Rade and Lucifer had them both careening into her path.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Argh! Nadia! Help me!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “But Lucifer, Eleanor’s about to kill Beleth! Someone needs to do
    something-”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Eleanor is <i>here!?</i> Where?” Lucifer broke away and threw a very limp,
    uncaring Rade down a chute of gravel. Nadia, scared, pointed to a nearby
cave. “Ha. The witch has something of <i>ours.</i> And that tiara    <b>will</b> be mine by nightfall.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Just don’t get hurt!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Rade bowed before slapping his pitchfork on the ground for emphasis. “I’d
    be more worried about you, Flora! You understand the <i>terrors</i> of a
    tag team with <b>me,</b> no? Come on, then!
    <i>
        Heeheehee!!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
Their joust came to a swift conclusion. All the agility and    <i>invisibility</i> did nothing against a sly foe who didn’t have to worry
    about a sneak attack. She needed backup. And as Rade pulled her gauntlet
    away, completely crippling her fighting ability, she received it.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hey, sir?” Somebody tapped Rade on the shoulder.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Huh!? <i>What is it!?” </i>
    <br/>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Keep the change!”</i>
    Nero knocked him to the floor with a cruel punch to the jawbone. “On your
    feet, Nadia! <i>Aamon,</i> keep Lexy and Alecto separated!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
None of the Purifiers had ever met Lexy, but they knew    <i> her combatant.</i> Concentrating all fire on the stranger was the best
    directive. Through all this, Zara had entangled her hooks around Alecto,
    and pulled her back.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Zara!<i> H-How!? </i>I thought you were gone!” She failed to cut the
    ropes, too wrapped up to even wriggle out for now. To the side, she spotted
    Eleanor. An explosion had her slammed against a rock spire. And now, Boreas
    wailed on her with un-pulled punches. “Boreas! <i>Enough!</i> Let her go!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Not until she’s unconscious!”</i>
    Boreas pulverized her to the point where the <i>entire mountain</i>
    crumbled to bits. The fallout was indescribable. Paired with the improvised
    meteors was Lucifer and Beleth. Whatever had taken place inside the cave
    was a mystery, but now both of their Aura was depleted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Ugh…” Lucifer rolled over a few times, finding immense difficulty in    <i>crawling. </i>He didn’t care. All that managed to make him stand again
    was <i>her</i> voice.
    <p>
    </p>

<p>
    “Lucifer! Your Aura!” Selene lifted her skirt off the ground to reach him
    faster. “L-Let <i>me</i> take your place. You’re too hurt!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Selene… Get out of here, <i>now.”</i> He gripped his side, leaning
    forward.
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Let me help! I can do this! Here, I’ll show you.” She tried skipping past,
    but he wrenched her back by her arm.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“No! You are <b>not</b> ready. Leave!”</i>
    He commanded, not at all privy to Merlin, who took the responsibility of
    helping those more affected by the landslide. The culmination of Lucifer’s
    insistence against Selene’s readiness to join combat was prepped to boil
    over, and Selene wasn’t having it. Ever since she’d been stuck here, and
    even beforehand, he’d <i>always</i> gotten in the way whenever she tried to
    <i>
        just help.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“I <b>am</b> ready! I am ordering you to move, <b>now!”</b></i>
Her judgement took a dive, and in her haste, she summoned    <b>Royal Necrocyst.</b> Lucifer could do nothing as Selene attacked him,
    smacking him far outside the vicinity of the skirmish.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Remainders of the fight moved deeper and deeper into Terra Insanire,
    leaving Lucifer to wonder what he’d done wrong while a river current
    carried him further away from Selene. All was lost.
    <i>
        “Why? Why is this happening to me? What should I do? I don’t know how
        to fix this. I tried my best…”

<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ha. <i>Talking to yourself, Lucifer?</i> Beacon’s definitely going to hear
    about <i>this.”</i> Somebody lifted him up and shook to rid him of the
    water. “We’d better get going. Team Lance isn’t going to save itself.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Maximus? </i>

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You have eyes, stupid? Of course I’m here to save you. <i>Troy</i> showed
    us the way. Eh, you look pretty beat up. C’mon, don’t be such a wimp. Let’s
    get out of here.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “None of this matters, you know.” Lucifer let Maximus hold him up. “None of
    it. We don’t have the Beryl Rhinestone. Once this is all over, we’re still
    lost.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nah, I’m just pulling your leg.” Maximus laughed. “It’s pretty easy. How
    do you think I got here? There’s a shortcut. All you have to do is walk
through this disgusting hole, and you’ll make it straight to    <i>Servus Portum!”</i>

<p>
    The rubble and confusion from Boreas’s attack on Eleanor, considering it
    brought down several hill’s worth of mudslides and boulders, left a fair
    bit of confusion. No one could see through the cloud of dirt. A fair few
    were pinned out of commission by unwarranted debris. Alecto was spared of
    that. Selene had to do something to keep her from killing Beleth, but Royal
    Necrocyst was too late.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
Alecto swerved past the enormous skeletal hand while dragging    <i>Tormentyst</i> off the floor, launching herself into the air to fall
    downward. If nothing new came forth, Beleth would’ve met an unsavory death.
    He
    <i>
        didn’t.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto landed hard, but before Beleth a lone faunus had zipped between
    them, and caught Tormentyst before he himself could be punctured through
    the bandages
    <i>
        again.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Huh? W-Who…” Alecto, hanging in the air as whoever this person was had the
    strength to hold Tormentyst outward, squinted to better assess the
    situation.
    <i>
        “Y-You!? Impossible!
        <b>
            Nomad!?”

        “Don’t let this taint your opinion of me, Keraseer. I am only here to
        extinguish the flames of strife, and bring peace. Your failure today
        shouldn’t stop you tomorrow. Remember that.”
    </i>
    To ensure both their safety, Nomad threw Tormentyst, Alecto included, to
    the east where he estimated a body of water to remain. Eleanor ruined his
    plans almost immediately by catching
    <i>
        both.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“The Cursed Faunus.</i>
    I dreaded the time we’d be forced to face each other. It would’ve been an
    honor to meet you if we weren’t on different sides. Stand down. From the
    blessing of Lady Clotho, I don’t have the <i>right</i> to strike a faunus
    down.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Then it is true.”</i>
    Nomad swept Idol’s Cloak aside.
    <i>
        “Another descendant has escaped even fate itself. The armor shining
        bright and hopeful, your sword emblazoned with the runic of age, your
        Aura unquestionably tied with the Arbiter. And only one eye- your skin
        as pristine as time. You are the Last of Clotho’s Coven, indeed. Do not
        pursue this path. The <b>gods</b> forbid it.”

    <p>
    </p>

<p>
    “He <i>should.”</i> Nomad loaded his crossbow and shot down Alecto’s
    attempts to get past him. The arrow snagged her cape, bolting her to a
    nearby tree.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Alecto!</i>
    How could you do this to her! Have you any idea what she’s been through!
    Beleth is a <i>monster!”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I understand exactly how she feels.Believe me. But
    I’ve had my own experiences with Delphics. Speak not of monsters. All those
    generations of wisdom, and still you have much yet to learn. And most
    important of all, you have something that belongs to <b>her.”</b> He
    pointed to Selene.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “M-Me?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yes. That tiara is <i>yours</i> alone. And now, I will <b>restore</b> that
    balance. Hand it over, Silver-Eyed Warrior.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Eleanor gave one last impassioned appeal.
    <i>
        “Enough of this madness, I beg of you! Come to your senses! The faunus
        in red has lost his mind, and if you succeed, there will be nothing
        left when he is done! Nomad, no! You must <b>stop</b> this!”
    </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “W-Who <i>are</i> you, anyway?” Beleth asked Nomad.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Right now? Your <i>savior.</i> Stay down.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nomad was on Eleanor in a second, showcasing firsthand the benefit of years
    and <i>years</i> of training. Certainly, the number had to be high. If
    Eleanor dared violate her religion and principles, she <i>may</i> have put
    up a fight. The details of that fight would remain unknown. Death was the
    fairer option for her, not that Nomad would take things <i>that</i> far.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    At the side, Lucifer and Maximus returned to Beleth’s elation. Besides
    those three, Alecto, and Selene; everyone else was either missing or out
    cold. The exception was Aamon’s clones, who were long since destroyed by
    the earthquake-caused explosion from earlier. “Selene! You’re alright! Get
    behind me!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“N-Nomad! Don’t do it!”</i>
    Alecto begged, trying fruitlessly to free herself. “Eleanor! Give him the
    tiara, before he does something terrible!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Never! I would rather <b>die!”</b> </i>
    She panted, enduring the stunning martial arts.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t need you to <i>die.”</i> Nomad gritted his teeth, reaching into
    the storage compartment of her cape for the tiara while he restrained her
    with one hand. “I just need <i>this.</i> Now, begone!” Once he had it, he
    kicked her in the rib-cage. Eleanor fell many feet back.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nomad, if you don’t stop!” Alecto began another threat, only to finally
    release her armor of the arrow. Now free, she ran forward to finish the
    job, and defeat Beleth while everyone else was busy. Nomad, Selene, and
    Lucifer <i>all</i> tried to stop her. What they didn’t know was that
    Eleanor had traded the tiara.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“’Prohibere!’”</i>
She held the Rhinestone in view. All travelers except <i>Alecto</i> and <i>herself</i> were petrified in a coffin of solid matter.    <i>“Now, Alecto! Do it!” </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Instantly, as opposed to the still form of everyone else, the statue of
Nomad <i>shook.</i> It then <i>cracked.</i> And then through untamed    <i>will,</i> he had broken the Rhinestone’s spell in under half a second.
    This gave him time to strike Alecto’s fabled sword out of her hands, but
    not enough to aim its trajectory.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The sword flipped through the air in a flash, Nomad’s force imploding
    Selene’s Aura, while also spearing her through the waist. Her muted
    reaction was to simply open her eyes wide, and gasp.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Selene!” Lucifer smashed out of the Rhinestone’s control and pushed
Maximus away, barely catching her. <b><i>“No!</i></b>    <i> Oh gods, no! Selene!”</i> The worry in his face was evident when he
    ripped his mask away, not even letting his suit do the work.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No!” Alecto held her forehead, her knees going weak. “I-I didn’t mean it!
    What have I done!?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nomad, instead of disciplining her, walked past, humbled.
    <i>
        “No. The fault is my own. I’m the one who sent it in that direction. I
        should’ve let you spear me, but time was short…”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He was far more imposing level-headed, his eyes beaming at <i>Eleanor.</i>
    He’d tend to Selene later. Eleanor, however, wouldn’t give up until her
    mission was complete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Lady Clotho forbid me from harming you. But there are no stipulations
    about using her possessions in defense.” She once again held the Rhinestone
    out, prepared to freeze everyone in a repetitive conniption.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Our time together is not over.” Nomad had his own tricks. The tiara
hadn’t lost the properties once used against Grover. “I eagerly await our next engagement.” Channeling his aura into the Relic, he caused a blast
    similar to the Rhinestone, though far more robust. While this had only been
used once before during initiation to blind enemies, in    <i>Nomad’s hands,</i> it could make them <b>disappear entirely. </b>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Wh-Where did she go?” Beleth grunted, pulling himself upward.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Banished. Exiled. She should be gone for the time being.” He explained.
    Eleanor must’ve been ignorant to the tiara’s powers. If she did know, she
    never expected Nomad to be as attuned. Either way, the Rhinestone would not
    be teleported with her. He scooped it off the ground. “I can see you
    reaching for the violin. Enough.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What are you- Gah!” Beleth struggled against Nomad, who grabbed him by the
    hood and carried him several feet away.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Selene needs my help. But first, I must explain something to you. This war
between you and the Keraseer is at an end. Are you hearing me? It is    <i>over.”</i> He didn’t release him, but his tone had Beleth listening.
    “She no longer wants to fight you. I could sense that in her the moment
    Selene’s life begun hanging on the edge. Do you want this nightmare to
    end?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “…Y-Yes.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Then <b>let</b> it end… I once knew a Delphic a lot like you.” He finally
    released Beleth. “He was young, but gravely misjudged by many… Including
    myself. He wanted to be a Huntsman. But when the time came, I had to stop
    him. And it… It cost us both dearly. Do not make his mistake, and force me
    to repeat the horrors of the past. Don’t you see?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Yes.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Lucifer… I-I’m hurt really bad.” Selene flinched in his arms. Alecto sat
    alongside him, crying, while he begged.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “I-I’ll fix everything, I promise! Hang on! Alecto? What do we do?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You need to remove the blade.” Nomad tried to distance himself
    emotionally. He waited for Lucifer to accept this before committing any
    action, although his hand was already enclosed around the hilt. “…You need
    to. There isn’t much time.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Fine. Do it.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m sorry this is happening, Selene. Close your eyes.” It was obvious how
    much it pained Nomad to see her in this condition. He slid the stained
    blade out in one quick movement, then handed it to Alecto. To stop the flow
    of blood, and dress the wound in a meager manner, he began wrapping his own
    bandages around her abdomen. Merlin hopped onto her shoulder, hoping to
    somehow ease her suffering. He licked the side of her face.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Th-Thanks, little guy…” </i>
    She exhaled.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Not much can be done for her here. <i>Come, quick!</i> I have the Beryl
    Rhinestone. She needs to be taken to the Augustus Correctional medical
    facility immediately.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“No!”</i>
    Lucifer pulled her away. <i>“I will carry her!” </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nomad shook his head.
    <i>
        “Even after all this time, you don’t trust me? I was once on the brink
        of death, not for the first time, all alone- and <b>you</b> carried me
        out of Summit’s Blight. Now, let me return the favor. I… I owe you this
        much.”
    </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer put his head down in acceptance. With everything that had happened,
    it wasn’t a surprise that everyone’s greatest and most persistent threat
    had returned. <i>The Creatures of Grimm</i> growled in waves, and they had
    everything to offer, from Ursas to Creeps.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Um, guys? How are we supposed to bring Selene back <i>and</i> fend them
    off?” Beleth panicked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>Nero</i>
    made his presence known. “Ugh, fine. I would’ve preferred to be paid in
    advance, but this’ll have to do. I expect recompense later.
    <i>
        Then again, I always did like training against these mutts.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Say no more!” Maximus fixed his bowtie, and settled his hat over his
    rapacious hair. “We will take care of <i>everything.</i> Go, quick! These
    Grimm have a lesson to learn, in <i>respect.</i> You can thank me later,
    Lucifer.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“I-I will. Let’s go.”</i>
    Lucifer hurried everyone along, witnessing how each ravenous spawn was torn
    asunder by Maximus’s command of cards.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Under Nomad’s direction and assistance, the outside world was finally
    within view. Selene, Lucifer, Alecto, and Beleth were <i>free.</i> The
    creaking of Terra Insanire’s doors opening was the greatest sound to meet
    Lucifer’s ears, in perhaps forever.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I cannot see you to Vale. Honestly, Empress Selene couldn’t be in better
    hands. Make sure she is alright.” Nomad handed her to Lucifer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“I will. I promised her I always would.”</i>
    His vision went funny with tears. He ran as fast as he could towards
    Augustus’ prison, with Beleth making sure nothing else went wrong.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Wait, Beleth!” Alecto prevented him from going further. She took off her
    helmet, and tossed it to him. “Make sure this stays by Selene’s side.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Beleth smirked, then complied. “You can count on me.” With each hand
    occupied by either a helmet or tiara, he left.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nomad! Before you go, I insist you give <i>me</i> the Rhinestone. I-I’m
    sorry.” She sniffled. “I want to fix things. I am going to set this right,
    and find the others. Let me-”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Say no more.” He grinned, and tossed her the opaque crystal. “You have a
    good heart, after all. I am going to miss you, Keraseer. Goodbye.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The first of diverted classmates was Lexy, who was approached under several
    heavy slabs. The clangs of armor plating was what woke her into regaining
    some senses, and looking up. “…Came back to finish the job huh, traitor?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No.” Alecto heaved the rocks off of her. “I’m here to save you. C’mon.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hmph! <i>About time</i> you finally helped one of your friends! As if that
    makes up for everything you’ve done. You already slaughtered half my team.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Beleth is safe. He’s in Vale with Lucifer, and… <i>Selene.</i> And we’ll
    rescue the rest.” She held a hand out for support.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So you’re with us, now?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yes.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…That’s a relief. You’re a tough nut to crack, let me tell you. But you’re
    back, thank goodness. I kinda missed the aloof rival thing we had going on-
    much more fun than this fighting.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I… I’m sorry. It shouldn’t have ever gone this far. And I never should’ve
    attacked you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Bah! Not like I couldn’t handle it.” Lexy’s cheeks went red in modest.
    “But, yeah. Truth be told, I was only ever along on the ride to help
    Beleth. …I was hoping you and I could still be friends.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Of course we still are! I didn’t mean any of those things I said, it’s
    just…” Alecto choked, covering her face. “How could I be stupid? I’ve
    ruined everything!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No use beating yourself up about it now.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Bravo, bravo!”</i>
    Rade snuck up on them, applauding. “This entire adventure was really one
    for the books! The <i>Fear Index,</i> specifically. I’m just glad I got
    front row seats to the show! At this point, I think I’ve been attacked by
    nigh everyone from both teams! Lucky me.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Shut up!” Alecto hugged him.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Hoo!</i>
    Easy there, gal! Public displays of affection are nada my forte! And an
    hour ago, I would’ve never guessed it’d be yours!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He’s not wrong.” Lexy tried not to laugh at the outlandish scene. “I think
    this is the first time I’ve even <i>seen</i> you without your mask.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto felt her face to confirm this herself. “So it would seem.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “As much as I love that lame old thing,” Alecto poised a fist at Rade.
    “Aha! Point is, I think going in <i>‘maskless’</i> will start to grow on
    you. Who knows, I’d like to be a knight. Helps me when I go into battle,
    you see. Maybe we can trade costumes sometime!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re not wearing a shirt.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He looked down, grasping his belly. “…Wow. You’re right.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“A-Alecto? Lexy?”</i>
    A hooded rogue wearing the robes of a devoted disciple limped over, holding
    her arm. “Is everything alright?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nadia!” Alecto ran over to prop her up. “Thank the gods you’re okay! I-I
    was hoping you made it out, invisible, but I’m just happy you’re not dead.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah, me too.” She was not only able to smile herself, but she managed to
    bring smiles to those <i>around</i> her. “Who’s left?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Besides you? <i>Zara.</i> Did any of you see her?” Their refusal formed a
    pit in Alecto’s stomach. “She’s the last one. I’ll find her.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
Lexy wouldn’t accept this. “What do you mean? I’m coming with you. This is    <i>our</i> team, remember?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “But it’s my responsibility. Just, please… Trust me. Once I have her, I
    will return to the entrance with the Beryl Rhinestone.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We don’t even know how to get back from here. <i>You</i> do. We can’t
    split up.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Well…”</i>
    The Travelling Merchant <b>Troy</b> plucked a flower off the ground and
    began emptying its petals into his satchel. With him, Maximus and Nero
    waited. Not only had the two killed off the Grimm, they’d hunted the group
    down <i>with</i> the land’s greatest navigator. “I would be happy to help!
    As long as you girls, and <i>one</i> gentleman, follow us.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…What do you think, Rade? Can Alecto handle it?” Lexy said.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He ruffled through the fear Index, bemused. “Oh, certainly. If anyone’s
    ripe for the job, it’s you, Alecto. We’ll be waiting for your return.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “See you soon.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The walk through Terra Insanire brought Alecto through many sites where
betrayal and hatred had scarred the once sacred land.    <i>Broken trees. Fallen monuments. Floods.</i> Reflection was her only way
    to cope. And Zara was <i>nowhere</i> to be seen.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Keraseer…”</i>
    Somebody called. It was <i>Aamon.</i> Everything had been taken from him
    save for his chest, arm, and head. He was dragging himself to a nearby
    ditch.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ha. You should’ve stayed quiet.” She raised her boot to crush him.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Zara.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What? What about her?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Zara Tir. She is over there. Over… There...”</i>
    With his last favor, the Purifier’s life faded. Alecto would forever be in
    his debt. Inside the thin but abyssal shaft, Zara slept near a lake. To be
    found this far from the fight, she must’ve sustained damage from the blast.
    There was <i>no</i> hesitation. Alecto used her landing strategy to
    reconvene.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Zara! Wake up. <i>Wake up!</i> Please!” Alecto raised Zara’s neck,
    throttling her to provoke a response where none came. She then held her
    head to Zara’s chest to check for a heartbeat. She was relieved to hear a
    faint, though consistent
    <i>
        thud. “Think, Alecto, think! The walls are too sheer to climb. M-Maybe…
        Of course!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If she used Zara’s hooks as a wire, and wrapped them around a thick branch
    sprouting from a tree near the surface, there was a chance she could lift
    Zara. One problem, though. It was all for nothing if there wasn’t somebody
    up there to catch her, and carry her back.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“You did not forget about me, did you?” </i>
    Boreas wallowed to her side from the pond. His semblance granted him access
    here. He too was looking for Zara. From the looks of things, he already
    found her, and was simply waiting. “By my calculations, you could use some
    aid.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Boreas! You’re here! Help me with Zara!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It is I who should be thanking you. <i>Without</i> you, she would be stuck
    down here. I already tried carrying her out of here, same as you. In fact,
you’ve already figured out the prime method- but that strategy needs    <i>three</i> participants. Here.” Boreas threw the hook further than Alecto
    could ever hope, catching the tree perfectly. He then tested it, and stood
    back. “The rocks are too slippery to be hooked onto, but surely your
combined weight can be supported <i>this</i> way. And trying to lift    <i>me</i> back up is useless for the same reason. I’m far too heavy. I will
    pull, you go with Zara. Carry her out of Terra Insanire.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“No.”</i>
    Alecto objected. <b>“I’ll</b> pull. <i>You</i> get her out of this. None of
    it would happened if not for me.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t be ridiculous. Once again, I’m too heavy. I wouldn’t have travelled
    to this land if I hadn’t considered this outcome. I’ve already come to
    terms with this. You’re a good friend, Alecto. Team Lance isn’t complete
    without you. On the contrary, Team Burnt will thrive just fine in my
    absence.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I can’t let you make this sort of sacrifice. Only I have the Rhinestone,
    and once I’m out of here, Nomad will want it back. Getting to Vale is
    already a trial, and none of it matters without <i>this.”</i> She presented
    the Beryl Rhinestone. Boreas <i>lowered</i> it.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Look around you. The only way out of here is through the water. Remember
    my semblance? I’m the only one in Beacon Academy who <i>could</i> leave
    Terra Insanire as we are now. It’s fine, really. I’m not saying it’ll be
    easy, but at least for <b>me</b> it’s at least <i>possible</i> to make
    progress. Hopefully, that won’t take <i>too</i> long.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “B-But I have to make this right! I need to atone for everything I’ve
    done!” She shouted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“You already have.</i>
    Now, go.” Boreas took a few steps back, ready to pull.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We’ll come back for you!” Alecto embraced him, then grabbed the line
    connected above. She made sure to take as much force off Zara as possible.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I know you will.” With all his strength, Alecto was born aloft to solid
    ground, with Zara in her arms. She waved goodbye. It was hard to make out
    through the scalding sunlight, but it was seen all the same. Boreas
    laughed, and happily did the same. Once the silhouette was gone, he wept
    tears of joy. It was over.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto did not see Boreas wade his way back into the lake, underwater. She
    did not see him <i>at all.</i> Without question, this uncertainty regarding
    the fate of the Thinker would last a very long time.
