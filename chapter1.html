<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Lucifer had
fallen from the skies and stuck the landing no problem, but now he had another issue.
He wasn’t the only student having been launched into the Emerald Forest, and save
for <i>one,</i> a single glance at any of them would have ruined everything. Where
Selene was, Lucifer hadn’t the slightest clue- gauging her through the clouds
seemed like a poor strategy in practice. She had plummeted from the heavens too,
that much was certain. <br>
<br>
The meadows made way for him. He ripped through the raised grass towards the
cliff face. It was a sight to behold, a walking archetype of war raising hell
through a picture perfect grassland. Lucifer let a growl at the mountain’s
edge, taking advantage of the high ground by raising binoculars to his eyes. <i>How
else was he supposed to find her before anyone else did?</i> There was nothing
to suggest <i>walking</i> would have been any more affective. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>He cursed
himself as he saw nothing, not a soul down there. The trees were just intrusive
enough to waste his time. He lowered the binoculars in shame, having
practically failed already. If only <i>Ozpin</i> had laid down rules that put
more control in the hands in the students, and not random chance. Lucifer was
left with nothing to do search the emerald expanses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hmph,” he
grunted, turning and nearly running into another student. “Fantastic.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hey!” A
feminine voice protested from the suit of armor, Lucifer swiftly pushing her
aside. “That’s not very charming, you know.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><b><i>“I’m</i></b>
not very charming, you know,” Lucifer scoffed. “Not today, anyway.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What, bad
teammates already?” she followed after him. Her voice resonated within her own
armor, <i>filtering</i> it, making it more sinister. “Initiation <i>just</i>
started, it can’t be that big of a deal. Name’s <i>Alecto</i>, in case you were
wondering.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I wasn’t.” He
continued jogging down the prairie. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…” Alecto
had the sense not to respond this time, partly out of restraint. Her own
patience was running thin with her new, <i>supposed</i> teammate. The duo
marched down the glades deeper into the Emerald Forest in silence, the only
sound being the caws of the crows circling above. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ozpin spoke
of a temple filled with relics. The students are likely to congregate there.
What do you know?” His abrupt conversation starter, if a bit gruff, at least
put them on track.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                                                                                              </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Alecto was
cut off, a massive bird-like grimm blocking the sun overhead with a screech. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I bet that <i>disgusting</i>
creature up there knows the way. Maybe we should ask it.” She contemplated snorting
at that last statement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“<i>Nevermore.</i>
That’s not <i>completely</i> insane, actually.” Lucifer looked up to see the
beast himself. “What’s your plan?” He didn’t have any means of controlling
grimm, nor garnering their attention. The fact that Alecto brought it up at all
meant she <i>had</i> to have something up her metallic sleeve. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I was
joking.” She shut that down. “…But it is <i>possible.</i> Even if we agitate
that <i>grimm-”</i> the contempt could be heard in her voice. “We’re too low
down for it to care.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“But higher
ground, and it’ll swoop past.” Lucifer finished her speech for her, already
switching gears, now racing to higher altitude. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“That’s the
highest crest in this forest.” The Knight pointed to a peak stabbing whatever
mists the skies had to offer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“A feat of
altitude.” Lucifer nodded. “Move. I won’t be waiting for you if you fall
behind.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Don’t
worry, we’ve <i>both</i> got capes to trip over.” The new accomplices continued
hiking towards the taller mountain, occasionally dealing with small grimm
packs. They were making good ground until one herd in particular caught them
both off guard. While Lucifer generally dealt with his enemies in the quickest
manner possible, with his <i>hands,</i> the surprise of the two beowolfs at
once forced him to ramp things up. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>He upgraded
to a firearm that acted like a sort of shotgun, one that occasionally needed a
refill of dust casings. The weapon was used more to push the enemies back than
kill them outright, even if it did do substantial damage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Alecto
watched, disregarded Lucifer’s fighting style, then contributed by throwing <i>her</i>
weapon: a short sword inscribed with runic symbols. The blade soared into the
back of a grimm, doing little more than forcing it on its stomach. It needed
more, thus Lucifer gripped the handle of the sword and added a few more stabs.
The final straw for the monster was when the blade twisted its vitals, courtesy
of Lucifer’s brutality. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Should I
bother asking your name?” Alecto sighed, figuring now was as good a time as any
to ask. She retrieved the saber and joined him alongside a deep trench with no
way across. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You’ll find
out sooner or later.” His response was quick. A crackling sound echoed
throughout the mountains, thanks to Lucifer’s combination of determination and
anger. Both pushed him to smash his fist into a nearby tree, snapping it
downward into a makeshift bridge. Before stepping on, he whipped his head
forward, motioning Alecto to go first. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What?”
Alecto did as she was told despite her distaste. All went well, that was until
yet another beowolf lunged from the bushes straight at her. She caught it by
the jaws, struggling both to keep her balance, and keep the creature at bay.
Lucifer <i>would</i> have helped, if he wasn’t dealing with grimm himself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Grah!” A
random boarbatusk used its strong outer armor and heightened speed, at least
compared to the beowolf, to blitz Lucifer down from the other side of the log.
He only had a moment to turn around before the spinning stack of power slammed
him square in the stomach and sent him across the tree, into Alecto. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The two
fighters and their adversaries tumbled across the log, albeit to the other side
of the gorge. The beowolf switched targets, aiming to take out the soldier
while he was down. It was on him in a second, repeatedly slamming him with its
claws in an attempt to breach the high-tech armor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Die!”</i>
Lucifer, having finally gotten come to his senses after a few powerful strikes,
grabbed the animal by its thick neck and hit it in the cheek with a curled
fist. The power sent it careening off of him into a daze. He finished the
onslaught by grabbing a hold of the tree he used as a former foothold. One
wicked swing and the entire chunk of wood was in pieces, with the grimm both
out of sight and commission. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Alecto got
to her feet in time to be rushed down, the Boarbatusk giving her the same
treatment it gave her colleague. The collision mixed with her retaliation sent
the grimm off the cliff, and left her hanging off of a clump of roots, mere inches
from freefall. It wasn’t going to hold long. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Enough
games!”</i> Lucifer hastily reached down, seized her by the cape, and wrenched
her up in a rather inhospitable manner. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hey! You’re
to blame! How hard is it to hold your ground against a <i>Boarbatusk!?”</i> She
brushed off her knees and shoulder. “You didn’t have to grab so hard.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The
raspiness of his voice never failed to convey his displeasure. “Well, you’ll
think about it next time.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Think about
<i>what?</i> Cleaning up <i>your</i> mistakes?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“The grimm
was sent off <i>with</i> you.” A snarl came forth. “Hardly a viable-“ </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The floor
shook with the nevermore’s roar. They were getting closer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I haven’t
the time.” Lucifer resumed his sprint to the top. Despite the quickest route’s insistence
on traversing smaller grassy hills and taking an indirect approach to the
summit, good progress was being made. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We’ve got
plenty of breathing room here, you know. They’re not going to run out of
relics, and even if they did, I bet we’re far ahead of the competition.” Alecto
acknowledged that, despite the several times she’d already tossed around the
possibility of leaving Lucifer, they were doing well. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I don’t
care about that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What <i>do</i>
you care about!? Why are you in Beacon? It doesn’t even seem like you want to be
here.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Are you,
like, stupid?” She couldn’t help but laugh. It was clear she was half-joking,
thus he let it go. “Nah, I get it. You’re looking for somebody, odds are they’re

they fight?” <i>No answer.</i> “…Hello?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What?” he

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“These are <i>not</i>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I see how

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>A few quips
later, and at long last the ridge had been reached. They were high above the
Emerald Forest now, in the wake of the rather magnificent sun. Alecto took in
the view, sighing, while Lucifer scanned the horizon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It’s right
there.” Alecto pointed at the colossal bird. “The one terrorizing the skies.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Lucifer gave
a short scowl then reached for his arsenal. A dust-powered <i>sniper</i> would
do well. Not only could he get a clear shot with the scope, he could also see
the <i>temple-</i> right below the nevermore. Accuracy wasn’t an issue. As long
as he repeatedly fired, he was sure to hit a target that big. Several shots
later, and Lucifer abruptly stopped. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><b><i>“Grimm!”</i></b>
He swooped around and blocked an incoming pounce <i>with</i> the sniper,
lurching back to avoid the slobbering bites of a beowolf. It didn’t last long.
Lucifer drove it back, once again utilizing the gun to <i>shove,</i> of all
things. The beowolf shook its head, only temporarily dazed after being slammed
into a giant boulder, and decided to attack the first thing it saw. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hya!”
Alecto ducked the claw swipe and skewered her enemy through the stomach. She
twisted the knife by kicking it back into the rock, now impaling the opposition
to the stone wall. It writhed in pain before fading to dust. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Huh, you

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Only <i>one</i>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I wouldn’t

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It helps me

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Don’t</i>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“What.”</i>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Lucifer
turned and inched towards her. <i>“Watch your tone.”</i> He spoke stern. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Body

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'> “Trust me,
there’s <i>plenty</i> more to fear.” Lucifer followed suit, the two now standing
eye to eye, sizing each other up. Even if Lucifer did have a height advantage,
he was still challenging an armor-clad knight that, so far, showed impressive
fighting skill. “But a <i>hag</i> with a sword isn’t one of them.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“How <b>dare</b>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The soldier
and knight clashed, but Lucifer’s reactive fighting style gave him an edge. Even
though he blocked practically every strike, he couldn’t land one of his own.
The short skirmish brought both to the steep ledge of an overhang. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Argh!”
Lucifer finally slipped up, receiving a brutal blow to his mask with her hilt.
His aura took a minor hit, but he was enraged none the less. Thanks to his
desire for nothing but payback, and perhaps to his detriment, he took the fight
<i>down.</i> Alecto was pulled with him, off of the bluffs, into a very open
abyss. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>An unlikely
ally came to their rescue, although it was strictly coincidental. Lucifer could
pat himself on the back for firing the sniper when he did. The <i>nevermore</i>
broke their fall. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Metal mail
and defensive armor met bird as the impact took a toll on both of them. Lucifer
landed at an angle hard, his bearings unclear. Alecto had it better, although
still bad, considering her new challenger took a majority of the impact. She
rolled several yards away, grasping whatever feathers she could find to hang
on.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The would-be
Huntsmen crawled to his feet atop the soaring monstrosity and ran at Alecto
just in time for his punch to be parried. What followed was a back and forth
bout as each combatant tried to one-up another. Alecto was first to make a
mistake, throwing all her eggs in one basket by putting full power into a
predictable downward swing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“You’ve
ruined everything! And for <b>what!?</b> Just to act all heroic?!”</i> Lucifer’s
weaved past, grabbing her arm and getting a good shot at her shining veil. His
next barrage sent her, and by extension himself, rolling onto the sail-like arm.
Not too big a deal, all things considered, until the nevermore started <i>flapping</i>
its wings. He lost his grip on her and was tossed to the opposite wing,
bordering the rim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“You’ll <b>not</b>
make a mockery of me!”</i> Alecto followed soon after, using her momentum to
fly through the air with the intention of slamming down her sword right on top
of a very vulnerable, flustered Lucifer. Her attack did some good damage, but
it forced him reeling off of the wing, and once again he <i>wasn’t</i> going to
fall alone. Lucifer used one hand to latch onto the last feather and another to
rip her down by her cloak. Thus Alecto tumbled over him, descending to the
surface far below. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Never!”</i>
He seethed, relishing his victory. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“You <b>coward!”</b></i>
Alecto’s claws tore through <i>his</i> cape, bunching it up so she could cling
to the fabric and keep herself in the fight. Lucifer couldn’t focus on pulling
himself up while <i>she</i> was holding him down. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“No… No!”</i>
His grip was slipping. <i>“I-I have to get to her!”</i> In a last ditch effort,
he unlatched the medals holding his cape. Alecto fell, still clinging to his wrap,
slipping through the air until she was indistinguishable from the green
labyrinth waiting on the surface. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Lucifer
hauled himself up and trudged to the middle of the nevermore in as quick a
manner as possible. Sure he was cruising through the sky atop a nevermore, but
he could still wait and catch his breath. Hardly any time for recuperation took
place before they’d met their destination. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Don’t
worry, I’m on my way.”</i> He paced to the edge and looked down. The temple sat
in contentment, waiting with open arms. It was time. Lucifer let himself fall. To
any watcher, it seemed a black speck broke the skies- perhaps a bird. But while
a bird couldn’t survive this sort of impact, <i>Lucifer</i> could, and he
already had earlier that day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Using the
same technique he entered the place with, he rolled past the shrubbery with unmatched
guile. Surely he’d keep it up and unlock the doors with equal finesse. They
were slammed open with blunt force. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>There were
too many students for a <i>single</i> temple-full of relics. Lucifer couldn’t possibly
know there were <i>multiple</i> in this forest, although it was far more likely
contestants launched near the same section would reach the same one. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>While the
bronze-colored castle resembled a pyramid from the outside, inside slept a
linear maze. Cobwebs caked the brown bricks. Insects squirmed in and out of the
cracks. Dust was swept into the air with every step. And worst of all, the
structural integrity of the temple was periodically tested. Something liked to
ram the palace and shake the very foundations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Lucifer <i>couldn’t</i>
have been the first to enter. The entrance to the main atrium was lined with broken
webbing. Somebody clearly stepped through, with all of it cleanly cut to the
side. This being the case, it was puzzling to see none of the relics missing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>They were

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Finally.”</i>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I think

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh! Sorry.”

right. “I didn’t realize I was still hidden.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You haven’t

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Besides the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The pair
returned to the surface in silence. The shaking had thinned out overtime,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Well, we’ve

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Lucifer
turned with a shotgun pointed right at her. She almost immediately understood
thanks to the insolent growling from behind. Nadia vanished from the naked eye,

reload. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>A moment of pure
confusion took over the beast, not that he cared to capitalize on it. Instead <i>Nadia</i>
took the reins, reappearing from the flanks. It was then that Lucifer noticed
her weapon. On each finger she wore a <i>needle,</i> and at the base each one
sported a different color. Their purpose was shrouded in secrecy. Regardless,
she shoved them into the back of the threat. Its reaction was as expected: a
tantrum fraught with anger along with a fervent bellow of rage. After a short
struggle it finally managed to rip Nadia off and chuck her into the air. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The sun
blinded anyone to her position and when she’d <i>normally</i> fall, nobody saw
anything. <i>Invisible again.</i> The beowolf must not have been very bright,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>It seemed
the grimm was undeterred, but just for a moment. It <i>started</i> charging

Ozpin took a sip of cocoa. “I’m aware he struck a nerve with you, but try and
understand <i>his</i> plight. Your new <i>friend</i> could either let you go,
or fall himself, sentencing both of you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I guess… Do
we even get to keep the relics we find? I suppose it’s not important. What
matters is finding them.” She let his words sink in. “…Not to mention he was in
a greater hurry than I was… Can’t imagine why, though.”  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Perhaps
time will tell. And you will be allowed to keep your relics.” Ozpin said. “But
I must admit, I didn’t come all the way here just to tell you that. I also have
a favor to ask.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“O-Of

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“This is
Miss <i>Selene Virtus</i>.” He stepped aside to fully reveal another teenager.
“If you would, she could use a hand on her way to the temple. She’s a tad
young, you see.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Nice to
meet you, Selene.” She had to bend over to offer her hand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh, um, nice
to meet you… My name’s Selene.” She accepted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I-I know.”
Alecto looked at Ozpin awkwardly. He gave her a reassuring smile. “It’s my
mission to bring you to the temple and find the relics, alright?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Don’t help
her <i>too</i> much.” Ozpin was already walking away. “I’d like her triumph to
feel well-earned.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I
understand, Headmaster.” She paused then led her new, <i>new</i> teammate in
the opposite direction. Hopefully this partner would prove better than the
last. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Your armor
is really pretty!” Selene lifted her bunched skirt to maintain a clear pace
through the pastures. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Aw,
thanks!” A compliment was a breath of fresh air. “I wish it looked half as good
as your dress.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Haha! Too
bad it isn’t very functional…” She struggled to keep it from getting caught on
the grass.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Well the
good news is, even if I fell off that nevermore, it still flew me closer. It
won’t be <i>too</i> long before we make it to the temple.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Why <i>were</i>
you on that big bird?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…Ordinarily
I’d never consider going near that <i>filthy abomination</i> unless I was trying
to <i>kill</i> the thing.” Alecto hesitated then brought forth a bare bones
recounting of everything that happened since initiation started. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“He insulted
me and I attacked him. The stranger took the fight to the nevermore, and, well,
you saw what happened next.” She finished. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You were <i>fighting
someone</i> on the bird!?” Selene looked at her with a combination of shock and
admiration. “Was it scary?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I was more <i>angry
</i>than scared, at least at the time…” The more she thought about it, the more
Alecto labeled her outburst unnecessary. “I mean, he was clearly a lone wolf.
His rush to find what I can only assume to be his friends didn’t help, but
maybe the guy’s just really fanatical about them. I can handle a little fall,
no problem.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Who could
blame someone for caring too much about their friends? If you think that’s bad,
you should meet- Gah!“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Something
zoomed out of the trees and tackled Selene to the floor in a flash. Whatever it
was had pretty substantial strength, but it was far too small for anyone to see
what it was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Selene!”
Alecto reacted as expected, the sword was drawn in time with her mask dropping.
She raised it but paused, fearing the possibility she’d hit her own friend. <i>W-What!?
A <b>bunny?</b> </i>She went from panicked to <i>confused.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>And she
wasn’t wrong, either. Wrestling with Selene in a friendly manner was a <i>pink bunny.
</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Heehee!” She
bobbed back on her feet and held up the animal, before shortly giving it a deep
hug. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…Did I get
in the wrong ship? Is this initiation or the<i> </i>Travelling Circus?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It’s
initiation!” Selene assured, still snuggling her friend before asking him a
question. “At least, I think it is. Wait, what does <i>‘initiation’</i> mean?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“So what’s
this little guy, your <i>pet?”</i> Alecto snorted out in a sarcastic manner. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                             </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yep!”
Selene completely misinterpreted her intent. “His name is Merlin! And it’s his
job to keep me safe <i>and</i> company! Isn’t that right?” She finally let him
go, lowering him so he could hop down to ground level. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“W-Wait a
minute! I thought that was <i>my</i> job!” Alecto said, meanwhile Merlin
bounced over to her to sniff her armor. “You’re not telling me <i>he’s</i> a
student too, are you?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“No, no, Merlin’s
just my friend!” They began walking further into the woods yet again. It was
then that the reflection of Alecto’s sword, still strapped to her back, shone a
light in her eye. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh, that’s
so cool! I love your sword!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh, aha,
thanks.” Alecto was blushing under her helmet. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Can I see
it?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh. Um,
okay.” She nervously reached behind her back. “J-Just be careful, alright?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Haha! Come,
evildoers!” She waved it around in a playful manner. Alecto couldn’t help but
let out a muffled laugh. “You are no match for <i>me!” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>As if to
answer the call, something large stomped out of the trees ahead just to let out
a hefty roar. The grimm was not unlike a bear, only a bit bigger, with black
fur and spikes made for gouging. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I-I take it
back!” She shoved the sword back to Alecto and hid behind her. Her protector
was ready to take on the cretin without question, that was, until her <i>other</i>
protector stepped up to the plate. Merlin leaped in front of them both and let
out a cute growl. It contrasted well with the Ursa’s mighty howl. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Merlin
charged forth and leaped onto the enemy, somehow knocking it flat on its back.
Such excitement led to a great scuffle with a terrible end. The grimm finally
got a grasp on the bunny, after many failed attempts, and slammed him <i>through</i>
a nearby tree. The wooden monolith snapped in two, but wouldn’t tolerate
falling over. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Merlin!” A
gasp from Selene came forth. It was seldom needed though as her friend got his
footing, grabbed onto the abominable thing with his tiny paws, and <i>pulled.</i>
To Alecto’s amazement and Selene’s encouragement, he forced the Ursa overhead
onto its back, shattering a nearby boulder into a frenzy of stone shrapnel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>He finished
the combo by grabbing the top half of the severed tree and whacking the fallen
grimm from above. Alecto had to shield herself from the bits of splintery wood twirling
in all directions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Why am I
even here!?”</i> She shouted, approaching the blast zone to contribute in her
own right. The Ursa staggered back and prepped yet another assault. A difficult
task, seeing as Alecto was already on it, scaling up its back and wrapping her
sword around the neck for a textbook chokehold. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The grimm
was forced away from Merlin, yes, but taking into account who was subduing it,
the alternate option of tumbling down the sheer mountain wasn’t exactly optimal
either. But downward awaited the temple, so nobody <i>really</i> cared.
Especially not when the Ursa unwillingly soaked up most of the impact. It
wasn’t until the end, when it crashed into an immovable tree sticking from the
side of the hill, that its ordeal ended. Alecto leapt off onto the only ledge
in sight, apposite the cliff. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Now a simple
ten-foot rift through the earth separated Alecto from Selene and her companion,
although <i>they</i> were maybe fifty feet higher in elevation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What should
we do?” Selene crouched down and pet Merlin. He nodded to her. “No, I can’t do <i>that…</i>
It’s too difficult, Merlin! That’s why we’re here.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Use your
landing strategy!” Alecto called from below. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I-I don’t
have one!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Right,
right. Okay, I’ve got it.” Standing ahead were two large towers, stone pillars perfect
for the job. Now, all she needed to do was break one of them such that it fell
over the gap, creating a ramp-like walkway across. <i>Alright, simple,</i> she
rationalized. <i>A gap between two hills, with one below the other, and two
stone monoliths. Okay, maybe it isn’t so simple.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                                                                                                                                                                               </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>She
positioned herself at the edge of the decline, then bolted forward. Upon
passing the first spire, she cleft it with her sword, cracking the base. Next
up, she began a sprint up the second spire, barely reaching the top just to
leap off. Alecto hit the first one with just enough force to topple it over,
crossing the gap. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“A-Alecto!”
Selene fell back. Her accomplice, despite her worries, fell with the bridge and
tumbled forward just to land next to her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’m good.”
Alecto hopped up, craning her neck to shake off the impact. “And even better, the
path is clear.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Good work.
We’re one step closer to the temple now, right?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Alecto
nodded and led the charge downward into the maze of foliage. As long as they
continued north like Ozpin said, they’d make it. “There’s going to be more <i>grimm</i>
here. So stay near me, okay?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Of course.”
Selene obeyed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ozpin <i>said</i>
you were young. How old are you, if you don’t mind my asking?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Just
fifteen!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Just</i>
fifteen.” Alecto chuckled. Merlin hopped forward to join her in the front. “That’s
pretty young for Beacon Academy… I mean, not in a <i>bad</i> way. It’s just,
you must be <i>some</i> fighter to have gotten in early.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh, aha.” Selene
let out a nervous giggle. “Well, there’s always room for improvement, right?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Huh.” The
sun echoed off of Selene’s chaplet. “I’ve never seen <i>that</i> type of dust.”
Alecto was referring to a crystal enthroned on the princess’s tiara.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Oh!
It’s- um,</i> it’s nothing special.” Selene stuttered. “I-It’s just for looks.”
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It does a
good job. <i>Wait.”</i> Something halted her. “What’s that?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The <i>top</i>
of an amber bastille lie just across ahead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It must be
the temple!” Selene hopped up and down. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“C’mon!”
Alecto ran across a bridge made of little more than wooden planks. That,
considering her heavy armor’s constant attempts to weight her down, was a bad
move. As expected, she fell through. On the bright side, holding on wasn’t out
of the question. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hold on!”
Selene stepped over and grabbed her hand. But she alone could not pull Alecto
up. Merlin had to pitch in too, but by doing so, <i>they</i> fell as well, and
the entire bridge broke into pieces. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Alecto could
handle the situation. But she had great doubts Selene could do the same. So she
grabbed hold of her midair and shielded her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Argh!” Her
decision took a chunk of her aura away, and it threw her sword to the outskirts
of the hole, granted it could have been much worse. The pet bunny landed in a similar
fashion, but due to his light stature it wasn’t <i>that</i> big of a deal. “I-I’m
okay!” Once she’d received that confirmation of Alecto’s good health, Selene
went to check on Merlin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>A <i>creeper</i>
of all things decided now would be the best time to intervene. With no weapon
to defend herself with, and a lack of recovery from her recent ordeal, Alecto
couldn’t do anything but <i>attempt</i> to wrestle it away. Selene’s eyes
locked on her troubled teammate, before gravitating to her dagger. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>”Get <i>off</i>
of me!” She barked. It didn’t listen, and the scuffle continued. It came to <i>quick</i>
end, however, once the creeper was stabbed through the chest from behind. Everything
froze until Alecto realized what happened and waited for the grimm to wither
away. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…Selene?”
The young empress in question was on her knees, looking down. <i>“Selene. </i>What’s
the matter?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I… I’ve
never killed anything before.” She broke out of her trance. Dead silence formed
a rift between the two. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It was a <i>grimm.</i>
It would have shown you the same mercy.” She held her hand out. “And you <i>saved</i>
me. It had to be done.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Y-You’re
right.” Selene accepted the offer. “It was just a grimm.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Grimm are <i>horrible</i>
creatures, a blight on mankind- born of darkness.” Alecto guided the band deep
into the temple, shimmying through the dank caverns. “They have no empathy, no <i>soul,</i>
truly disgusting. You were right to kill them.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I know.
It’s just, I’ve fought grimm before, but I always leave the last part to
Merlin.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Never mind
that. Look at this.” They reached the center. “These must be the relics. Which
one should we take?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh, we need
to take <i>this</i> one!” She was quick to choose. A fair few relics were
already missing, but the one she was searching for was spared. “The black
horsey!”  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Alright, if
you say so. That’s one of my favorites in chess, anyway.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The outside
world welcomed them back. A straight shot forward brought the trio to the brink
of a mountain.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Our quest
is done- now we just rebound back to the beginning.” Alecto hiked to the
cliff’s end.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yay! I
actually made it past my first day! And it’s because of you, you did it!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Don’t be
silly. <i>We</i> did it.” The trio stood, locked in time, entranced by the
sunset. For a moment the only thing that broke the silence was the airy breeze
and ambiance of the forest. It was not to last, as frantic but calculated
footsteps were added to the mix. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Alecto was
given just enough time to look back and push Selene away in a panic, as a
familiar friend was already at her throat. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Lucifer!?”
Selene herself stumbled to the floor, dirtying her dress. As she observed,
Lucifer rushed into Alecto, what she <i>couldn’t</i> comprehend was his reasons
why. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>He let out a
snarl, tackling Alecto to the ground. “Get <i>away</i> from-!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Something
big and bulky smashed out of the floor, interrupted Lucifer, and blasted chunks
of ground everywhere. The new <i>grimm</i> snatched him off of Alecto and threw
him back down, once again tossing shrapnel around. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Argh!”
Lucifer redirected his attention to this <i>thing.</i> What stood forth was an amalgamation
unlike anything he’d ever seen, a grimm holding a round physique <i>and</i> a
terrifying grin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Selene! </i>Behind
me, now!” Lucifer ran in front of her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What <i>is</i>
that!?” She followed his command. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“That</i>’s
the <b><i>Grover!”</i></b> Alecto raised herself <i>and</i> her sword. “Think
of it like a giant gopher! Keep your distance, and don’t stop moving!” <i>First
things first, study the battlefield. An open area and a square barrier <b>right</b>
on the edge of a cliff. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>This grimm
seemed foreign to its combatants. Fat and circular, with razor teeth to match,
the <i>Grover</i> couldn’t be overestimated despite matching only an alpha beowolf
in height. Lucifer dismissed Alecto’s advice and stood his ground, firing upon
the behemoth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Grover
laughed it off. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You <i>fool!</i>
That’ll just agitate it!” Alecto berated her rival, not that he could even hear
her. He was too busy <i>missing</i> this freak, who tunneled underground, and
getting caught out- although Grover merely lunged past with a <i>different</i>
target in mind. Its approach failed. Instead of taking out Selene as planned,
its jaws closed around Lucifer’s <i>arm.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“No!”</i>
He wrestled around, slamming his fists on it over and over, making <i>sure</i>
it went nowhere near Selene. Grover <i>had</i> to put an end to the barrage. Thus
it slid underground, taking Lucifer with it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Merlin!”
Selene failed to stop him from following the train of destruction. Alecto
stopped <i>her</i> from doing the same, pulling her to the backline. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Stay
there!” It was time to raise the stakes. “Grover is a deadly potent entity.
Despite my own hate for those <i>demons,</i> you <i>must</i> respect their
power. Be aware.” Her cape was pulled back to reveal a second weapon, one she <i>resisted</i>
using this entire time. Her <i>old</i> brand was already impressive: a
traditional silver short sword with symbols up and down the blade. This new one
resembled a golden broadsword with a jagged pattern cut out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The ground
was torn up, surely a result of Grover’s expedition through the surface.
Whatever was going on below, it was causing an eerie ruckus. Selene was hoping
Alecto’s extreme caution was unfounded, otherwise they might <i>actually</i> be
in trouble. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Fortunately
the ground puffed up beneath and <i>past</i> them. Lucifer was the first to pop
out, Grover pushing him upward with untamed ferocity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Grah!” He
was slammed into a massive concrete idol, one of the few manmade structures
that <i>wasn’t</i> eaten up by the forest. Grover was like a gorilla in nature,
simply swinging on its foe rather than using its claws. After rolling with the
punches for a moment, Lucifer had the sense to respond with one of his own.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Grover
rolled back, giggling every chance it had. Whether it had a backup plan or not,
it didn’t matter. Merlin was <i>going </i>to hop out of the hole after them and
stop the grimm either way. A pair of paws tugged the gargantuan gopher away
just to throw it back. Lucifer was ready and ducked, giving Grover the same
treatment he himself had received moments ago.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Enough!
Punching won’t do anything!” Alecto shouted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>A few hits
later and Lucifer was forced to dodge yet again. A swishing sound was warning
enough without having to actually <i>see</i> the gold cleaver impale the
digger. Grover whooped louder. It seemed as the laughing continued, it became
more dangerous. Now they had to deal with a terrible cyclone attack ideal for
swerving in all directions. Alecto wouldn’t give up the sword though. Seeing as
it was still lodged in Grover’s back, she <i>too</i> spun off the ground. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Everyone
else dodged, meanwhile she did little other than hold on, disregarding the
disorientation. Fortunately the longsword gave up before she did, finally detaching.
<i>Unfortunately,</i> she was now streaming through the air with enough
velocity to crack the familiar rock wall that ended up halting her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Are you okay!?”
Selene crawled over to her and helped her up, although Alecto barely needed it.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Never
better.” Alecto was pelted with something furry, falling back onto the slab.
“Merlin!? You’re supposed to be on our side!” Next up was Lucifer. <i>He</i>
fell even harder, squashing both of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Argh! Alright,
<i>‘Grimm Expert.’</i> How do we beat it!?” He grappled Alecto to her feet.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“The Grover’s
too durable. Only this blade can-“ </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Lucifer
didn’t care. He wasn’t about to sit around listening when Grover was busy
closing in on <i>Selene.</i> They traded blows, flying back to their corners.
But as far as <i>Selene’s</i> casualties, her <b>headdress</b> was the only
thing she lost. When Lucifer skid into her in as gentle a manner as possible,
it fell loose.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“My tiara!”
She reached forward in pure desperation. The token rolled away into the
clutches of the enemy. Grover was in hysterics, glaring down at the shiny
object. It impulsively raised its spiked foot before bringing the hammer down. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“No!”</i>
Lucifer swung into a full sprint as Grover put all its weight onto the
headpiece. He was too late. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>But the
circlet <i>didn’t</i> break, rather, it did the <i>opposite</i>. A surge of
blinding light came forth, and the explosion did escalating damage based on
proximity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Grover was
nowhere to be seen, granted nobody <i>could</i> see for a solid few seconds.
Nobody but Lucifer, whose visor shielded his eyes. That didn’t change the fact
that the shockwave blew him back into the concrete structure. After so much
abuse it finally gave out, shattering itself as well as Lucifer’s own aura. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Lucifer!”
Selene cried out. She ran over to the edge as fast as she could, relieved but
still alert at seeing him hang onto the ledge. “C’mon, you can’t fall now!” She
grabbed his hand but could do little to help him up without further assistance.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Here!”
Alecto came to her aid. With the two of them, it wasn’t long until Lucifer was
back on solid land. All four took a second to catch their breath. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Selene!”
Lucifer embraced her. His mechanical mask retracted to show his true eyes, his
appearance no longer complimented by the red ghastly ones he normally donned.
Alecto was surprised it could even do that. “Thank the gods! You’ve not laid
eyes on any other students besides her, right? Tell me you picked the black
knight!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“That’s
right, just like you said! We’re <i>teammates</i> now, Lucifer!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“And I
couldn’t forget about <i>you.”</i> His voice turned coy, capturing the
attention of Merlin. “You kept her safe, didn’t you?” The bunny nodded before cuddling
up against him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“He wasn’t
the only one.” Alecto crossed her arms. “I finally caught your name. <i>Lucifer,</i>
huh? Not bad, although a <i>thanks</i> wouldn’t go amiss.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You
protected her?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“At Ozpin’s
request.” She tried to act aloof, but her good deed couldn’t be denied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…Thank
you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Aw, how
sweet!” Selene cheered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Ugh.</i>
You don’t still have my cape, do you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It’s in a
tree somewhere.” Alecto admitted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Wait a
second! Where’s the <i>tiara!?”</i> Lucifer’s mission was never over, it
seemed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Where the
tiara sat, nothing <i>visible</i> remained. The mystery became clear as soon as
Lucifer bolted over and <i>hit</i> something. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What!?” He
kept himself from falling over, arming himself at the slightest sign of
treachery. Ahead of him <i>Nadia</i> materialized, and with her the tiara did
the same. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“S-Sorry!” The
rogue scrambled to her feet and offered the prized possession forward. “This
belongs to you, doesn’t it?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Nadia!?
What are you doing here?” He quickly took it back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh, well,
um. You guys are my teammates now. I <i>had</i> to keep tabs on you.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Wait, you
two ran into each other?” Selene centered her tiara. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“At the
temple.” He clarified, reaching back and presenting his relic. Alecto did the
same, holding up the chess pieces in the air. They caught the sunlight well
enough to provide a great glint. It made sense as they were positioned on a
high valley overlooking the entirety of the Emerald Forest. The sight was
magnificent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“How
appropriate. <i>Black knights.”</i> Alecto remarked, still raising the relic
and watching the horizon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I wonder
what these pieces do. They can’t mean anything, can they? Do you think
Headmaster Ozpin will let us keep them?” Selene asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Maybe. Just
in case we can hold onto them, we should give them some sort of meaning. Like,
as our first achievement in Beacon together. It’s just an idea.” The suggestion
from Nadia garnered a wave of excitement. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“No, it’s
good! You’re right. Ozpin told me we’d be able to stash them. These should
stand for something. As long as each of us has one of these relics, we’ll
always have each other’s backs. Right?” Alecto nudged Lucifer in the shoulder. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…Affirmative.
To the Black Knights.” They cheered. All that was left to be done was return to
the starting point. At their high altitude, it could be seen in the distance.
An effortless trek back. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Anyone else
dead tired?” Alecto questioned her new friends, Lucifer specifically, while musing
at the elegant simplicity of Beacon Academy’s hallways. “It probably doesn’t
help that you <i>asked</i> for the top floor.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Um, there’s
an elevator, you know.” Nadia pointed at the lift, her fingers exaggerated by
the iron nails. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh. I <i>didn’t</i>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I figured
you could use the exercise.” Lucifer chuckled for the first time since arriving.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You’re
unbelievable.” Alecto did the same. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I think
this is the room.” Lucifer was reading the directions on his scroll. On one of
the doors remained a card with metallic letters printed on it. <i>LANS,</i> it
read. “Affirmative. <i>Team Lance.”</i> He unlocked the entrance to his new
dorm room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Alright!
Team Lance is ready to roll!” Selene threw the door open and ran inside, then
immediately collapsed on one of the beds. Nadia held back laughter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Not bad. It
could be a little roomier, though.” Alecto noted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“The closets
are pretty big. And there are <i>two.”</i> Lucifer was already on the case,
interviewing Nadia and Alecto. “How many clothes do you two have?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Me? Uh- My

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I have a

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“As do I. So

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Great.”
Lucifer didn’t want her to have the chance to refuse. “So, we’ll put one bed in
the <i>closet,</i> two beds on either side of the room, and <b>throw one away. </b>Does
that sound like a worthy plan?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“That makes
no sense. <i>First,</i> what do you mean we’re throwing one away?” Alecto
brought up a good point. “So you’re telling me somebody’s going to be sleeping
on the ground? It won’t be me, I’m telling you that right now.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I don’t
need a bed.” Lucifer laid it down. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…You don’t
need a <i>bed?</i> Are you sure?” Nadia detached her glove and set it on one of
the corner-beds. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Affirmative.”
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I mean, I
guess I’m fine with sleeping in the closet. Does it have a lock?” Alecto
proceeded with the inspection. “Oh, it actually does. Okay, I can make this
work.” She was already effortlessly heaving the mattress, bed-frame included,
and tilting it through the door. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“There,
perfect floor plan. I’ll take care of <i>my</i> bed by daybreak.” He fake
clapped for himself then walked over to open the window. Selene pulled herself
off the bed to join him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Woah!” She
gasped. A majority of the combat school could be seen all the way down to the
courtyard near the entrance. The Emerald Forest and its neighboring bay
couldn’t be missed, and behind it a bombardment of <i>silver mountains</i>
lurked, illuminated by the shattered moon. Had they been on one of the lower
floors, such a view would be impossible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Lucifer put
his hand on her shoulder. “Pretty good, huh? I know the view’s not as good as
the one at home, but it should suffice.” She gave him a hefty hug. It was hard
to believe she’d already crossed the first hurdle of Beacon Academy. But there
were far more to come. As new students under Ozpin’s watch, the four had
jumpstarted a new journey. They were eager, although not quite ready, to tackle
whatever threats Remnant was willing to throw at them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Perhaps our
heroes should bear in mind the dangers of such a task. This place is
unfriendly, wary, hardly the place for a bunch of teenagers. <i>Huntsmen and
Huntresses?</i> That was another story. </p>
