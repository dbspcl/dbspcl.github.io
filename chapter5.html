        “I left for thirty seconds and this is what I find when I come back? How did
        you <i>do</i> this? Are you stupid?” Zara heaved.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Simply eccentric.” Rade corrected her. Her searing hooks were wrapped
        around the base of his pitchfork, which was presently jammed into the
        ground. Despite all the pulling, Zara couldn’t dislodge it. After a grunt
        of discord, the scarecrow commandeered the entire operation, grabbing the
        fork by the prongs. He <i>looked</i> like the victim of a severe eating
        disorder, and while he was stronger than he seemed, it was no surprise such
        little progress was made.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “This is <i>your</i> pitchfork. Isn’t there some sort of switch to give a
        leg up?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
    “Right you are!” Rade likely wasn’t listening, only hearing    <i>‘switch’ </i>and doing as told. He activated the compacting feature,
    funneling the handle into itself for easy transportation. But since he was <i>holding</i> the pole, Rade was smacked onto his face with a worrying    <i>crunch</i> sound. He tiptoed over to the one available pram and stroked
        his chin. “There must be another way! Why would my weapon be so stuck in
        the floor? Could it be the
        <i>
            barbs?”
            <p>
            </p>
        </i>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Why would it be in there at all!? No problem- I really wish we had some
        air in here, let me just turn on the fan and- Oh, we can’t! Your <i>bed</i>
        is on it!” She gestured to the sleeping bag hanging on the ceiling fan.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>“You</b>
        put your crib outside, see? I’m pointing right at it! Contestant <b>two</b>
        put theirs in <i>front</i> of the window, so you have to crawl over it
    every night! As for little <i>grimster,</i> he’s the only one here who    <i>has</i> a conventional bed!” Rade smacked the mattress with angered
        ferocity over and over, ruining the sheets, but his voice and mannerisms
        confirmed it was just another nutty skit. The two remaining teammates loved
        being absent from these affairs, tending to their own outlandish ones.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “I can heat myself up just fine, why would I mind the night sky? I don’t
        know why <b>she</b> can’t do the same, she also uses fire!” Zara hinted at
        her partner, proving her point by simmering flames off her hooks,
        invulnerable as always to the blistering heat.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “So we’re all crazy! Take notes from the <i>‘Flying Dutchmen’</i> in
        future, he’s more normal than anyone on this team! And that’s mighty
        impressive considering he’s a
        <i>
            De-“
            <p>
            </p>
        </i>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Perhaps if Team Blazer’s two missing members were here, they could do
        something about the current conflict. But somebody stronger than either
        broke down the door, interrupting Rade’s rant.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “The <i>Beryl Rhinestone,</i> it must be here somehow! With its power, the
    research will become clear, my calculations will be without question.    <b>Rhinestone!</b> <i>That</i> is the key to my experimentation!” This tank
        of a man lumbered through the doorframe, almost catching the top of it with
        his hat, and began ravaging through the cabin.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Boreas?! What’s the big idea?” Zara’s surprise was evident.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “I’ve lost the Beryl Rhinestone! I had it earlier, walked in here, now it’s
        faded from my possession. The thing has a mind of its own, I tell you! The
        Rhinestone is hiding in here, of that I am certain. Aha!” Boreas’s voice
        was in a league of its own. Hollow and raspy, but at the same time guttural
        and packed with clever articulation. It matched his height and stocky
        build.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Ripping the blankets off of the nearest bed revealed a perfectly spherical
        gem. Able to barely fit in the palm of its seekers hand, the Beryl
        Rhinestone emitted an earthy glow that matched its magenta core. When it
        was lifted off the bed, Rade’s trident was launched out of the ground into
        the ceiling without intervention.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Oh! That piece of diamond was holding my weapon down! I’d seen it earlier,
        but paid no thought to it.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “You did!?” Both Zara and Boreas were dumbfounded with this stupidity.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Yep! Little unnerving if we’re being honest here, I couldn’t tolerate
    anything in this room being more mysterious than me! Except, of course,    <i>you!”</i> Rade wiggled to Boreas’s side, noticing how his slouch made
        him half the brute’s size. His textbook of horrors warped out of the wall
        into his hands. “So If I’m stoked by that limestone, <i>you</i> must be
        terrified! Right?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
    “The Rhinestone gains only my respect, not my fear. And for that, I    <i>admire</i> it.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “It actually stabbed the pitchfork into the wood and kept it there, huh?
        That’s… kind of amazing, actually. Where’d you get this thing?” Zara fixed
        her hair.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “It was given to me in it Summit’s Blight, believe it or not. Going off the
        beaten path seemed like a fine idea in my head, most of them are. I’d
        gotten lost, though. This stone was paramount in finding my way back. In
        fact, I was planning on going there later today. Its origins befuddle me.
        If my estimations are correct, there might be more of its kind deeper down.
    Although I must admit, it’s more an assumption then anything the    <i>numbers</i> have told me.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “All I found was a strange deer faunus. Sure we got lost, but as long as we
        stick together we’ll make it out. We always do. Of all the times we’ve been
        there, we’ve never regretted it.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “The one time, you mean!” Rade pestered.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Whatever, <i>I</i> had fun. I’m open to going again, if you need any
        assistance. I bet Selene would be on board, too.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “The rest of <i>Team <b>Burnt</b></i> is busy with the weekend’s homework.
        I could always use a helping hand from a good friend.” Boreas put the
        translucent rock under his layers of leather padding.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Do you think Team Burnt is going to be fine without their leader? I always
        got the feeling you were sort of the brains of the operation.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “You’re quite receptive. Selene, however, might not be ready for a trip
        back with only <i>us</i> as her guardians. Then again, I’m only going to
        the <i>base</i> of the mountains to make some measurements. It’s there that
        I’ll gain the answers needed for a second trip. As long as we stay above
        ground, the threats within the Blight should yield. Least, that’s what my
        readings have told me. We could be in and out in mere minutes.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “I think you’re underestimating Summit’s Blight.” Zara remarked. She could
        only assume her adventures there were far more perilous than his.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Still, in less than a half hour a rag-tag team lineup of Boreas, Zara, and
        Selene were assembled on the gray hinges within the cliffs. Most of that
        time was spent just running to the oversized formations. Rain made way for
        them, although it never fully quit. At its best the air was incredibly
        misty, but mostly it was at its worst. The dreary clouds cloaked
        everything, letting in very little light- a great departure from sunny
        Vale.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “The view is really pretty! Even if it’s sort of… sad looking.” Selene
        tilted her head.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Very true indeed. I wish I could use this machine to see the little
        details, but I have a lot of work to do.” Boreas set up what resembled a
        telescope, with several metal rulers slotted out of the tube. They were
        standing above an overhang, nothing but limitless drops on every side.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “All work and no play, huh?” Zara prodded.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “One of the three of us has to stay on track, no?” He laughed.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Four, actually.” Selene held Merlin up to her nose and played a few cute
        games with him. “I hope this rain lets up. This little guy can’t swim, and
        my dress makes it hard to do the same! As long as we’re above ground,
        that’s not a problem…
        <i>
            right?”
            <p>
            </p>
        </i>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “For me, it’s not an issue at any height. The innate ability to breath
        underwater was likely earned from my affinity with alchemy as it requires a
        vast knowledge of the aquatic arts. All thanks to my semblance.” Boreas
        held the Beryl Rhinestone up to the light alongside his appliance. It
        shimmered with a beauty barely matched by the rays set upon it.

    </p>
    <p>
        “Really? Mine’s the exact opposite.” Zara wrapped her right hook around her
        arm and set it ablaze, her skin somehow not scorched. “What about you,
        Selene?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “It’s, um…” She looked Merlin in the eyes, her face dropping. “N-Never
        mind.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The same back-tingling screech that loved shaking the land returned with
        more than a vengeance. There was no doubting it was the same crazed howl
        they had heard the first time. Selene racked her brain to recall the lesson
    Nomad gave on the matter.    <i>“What was it called? The Grand… something?”</i> With the sound, the
        Beryl Rhinestone slipped out of Boreas’s fingers.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>“No! The Stone!” </i>
        He almost jumped after it. Slowly, the purple dot disappeared into the
        distant fog.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Ah! You dropped it!” Zara followed his lead.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>
            “I didn’t! It leapt out of my hands, I swear it! <b>Blast it all!”</b>
        </i>
        He slammed his fist on the ground, fracturing the rock. Zara, having
        witnessed the brilliant influence of the jewel earlier, figured he was
        probably right. “We have to get it back!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Are you out of your mind!? We can’t go down there, it’s too dangerous! We
        could die!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
    “The Rhinestone is worth it, I assure you! We can do it, we are    <i>warriors!</i> This device revealed to me the depths of this crater, it’s
        hardly that deep!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “No, it can’t be done. I was down to come here for sightseeing, but we
        can’t afford going deeper. I was told the Summit was confusing, it abides
        by its own rules. You should know that better than anyone.” Zara shook her
        head.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Told by who? Trust me, there’s <i>nobody</i> who’s studied these mountains
        more than me.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Maybe it’s not such a bad idea. I kind of wanted to go exploring anyway.”
        Selene nodded, disregarding the warnings from her faunus friend. Boreas was
        already strutting down into the depths, solidifying the journey to find the
        Rhinestone. Zara sighed, rolled her eyes, and complied.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Almost immediately Grimm felt it necessary to intervene, the change in
        elevation already taking a toll. The Princess hid behind her current
        bodyguard, a ready and waiting Zara. But without any request, Boreas stood
        in front of <i>her,</i> winning the fight for dominance without issue. His
        immense stature triumphed over the Grimm, but his slow speed held him back.
        He could protect both of them either with his bruising strikes or just by
        shrugging off the attacks, but it was up to his friends to <i>let</i> him.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Zara wanted her piece of the pie, diving out of cover to kill a few demons
        herself. Stabbing them, grappling them into each other, or stringing them
        into a nearby convenient wall or pit; it didn’t matter, she was absent in
        the heat of battle.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Insipid creatures!” Boreas lost himself in the bloodshed, determined to
    find the Rhinestone, bashing Creep after Creep at the cost of his Aura. A    <i>violent</i> display, it was. He had no problem enduring the abuse that
        came with <i>punching</i> mobs of Grimm. Lucifer, by comparison, was
        deliberate while also being technical, but lacked the sheer crushing power
        of Boreas. Now Merlin was all that stood between Selene and the slobbering
        jaws of a Beowolf.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The fight between the bunny and the beast took Selene away from her allies,
        separated by a wall of stalagmites. Evidently one Grimm was no match for
        Merlin, but now strayed from the path, there was a new setback.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Guys? Guys!” Selene ran back to where she thought her friends were, but
        alas, she found herself in a completely different room. The conundrums of
        the dismal hills never changed. “Ugh, why does this keep happening to me?
        What should we do, Merlin?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        He swayed his head and ears, looking up.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “You’re right! Just go exploring. That’s why we’re here, right? You can
        take out anyone…” She paused. “<i>Me?</i> I still can’t do <i>that,</i>
        Merlin… I will soon, though!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        She wandered through the open caverns somehow devoid of Grimm, and took in
        the sounds of the scenery. She could appreciate the charm of an overcast
        drizzle, but in the back her mind lingered the fact that she <i>was</i>
        lost. And now, shocked. Resting in an open crater was a single raised
        segment of train tracks. One large pillar held up the disembodied platform
        for what looked like a monorail.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Technology? How could there be a train through here? Maybe I can make a
        call, then!” She tried her scroll. The moment anyone set foot on Summit’s
        Blight, all connection to the outside world from within had been cut. Even
        with signs of machinery nearby, that didn’t change. She sighed.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        There were two options now: back the way she came, or away from the
        landmark onto a treacherous path. The way forward was tough, and would
        require shimmying. One wrong placement of her feet and down she’d go, but
        Selene’s light build and love of dancing set her up well. If anyone one
        could make it around the cylindrical slit, it was her.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The first ten of eleven treads went well, but Selene only realized how
        unsteady the terrace was as she stepped on it. The entire path crumbled
        under her weight, and she collapsed. A fall from this height was something
        few could recover from. But finally, after a streak of bad luck, Selene
        struck gold as she was caught by something, or rather <i>someone.</i>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “N-Nomad!” She gasped. The mystical deer faunus she encountered <i>last</i>
        time was back, and had saved her. Nomad pulled Selene up and laid her down,
        still holding onto her arm.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><i>“What are you doing here?! I told you never to come back!”</i></b>
        He scolded her, holding back from shouting.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “W-What? I thought it would be fun to-“
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>
            “Anything in the Blight is cursed! Not a living soul is to step foot in
            this place!”
        </i>
        Nomad kneeled to be on her level, making himself clear.
        <br/>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “I’m sorry. I didn’t think it was a big deal.” She pouted, holding back
        Merlin from jumping the traveler. All three froze at the iconic screaming
        of Summit Blight’s most terrifying Grimm.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>“…It’s close. Move.”</i>
        Nomad got to his feet and began striding away. She had no choice but to
        trust him as her only saving grace. Her other two friends were missing in a
        similar predicament, although <i>they</i> weren’t using a lost nomad as a
        lifeline.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Told you this was a bad idea.” Zara said.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Things may not have gone according to plan, but I assure you, we’ll make
        it out of this. Selene has her bunny with her, and we’re more than
        capable.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Just wait until Lucifer finds out about this. He’ll have your head.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Ah, yes, the Leader of Team Lance. A tactical little lad sealed in armor
        with proficiency as sharp as his temper. You see, I’ve studied each team
        extensively. Assuming Selene gets out in one piece, I’ll be fine.” Boreas
        outlined his view on the matter, looking through a leather journal.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “You clearly haven’t faced him.” Zara giggled.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “No, but I’ve got the Rhinestone! With it, I’ll be in satisfactory order.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Well you don’t have it <i>yet.”</i> Zara reminded him, reaching a square
        alcove with a straight shot to the exit. It wouldn’t be outlandish to
        assume Boreas fell through the floor because of his weight, but only if he
        broke the ground. Instead, he <i>sunk.</i> “Quicksand!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Not quicksand. Not even sand. In fact, it’s not even <i>real.”</i> Boreas
        dipped his hand into ooze, witnessing the granite-like surface warp and
        drool around his arm. He felt nothing. “Give me those hooks. See?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The light dissipated the illusion, revealing Boreas not be stuck in
        quicksand, but rather well-adjusted on solid platforming a few feet below.
        “What? Did you expect some long, drawn out drama involving quicksand? Sorry
        to disappoint.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “So as long as we’re here, we’re just going to get screwed with? Wonderful.
        And now we have to cross a gap, even better.” Zara pointed out a gorge.
        Obviously <i>she</i> could get across by means of swinging, and she did
        just that, but the cumbersome giant alongside her wasn’t as fortunate. He
        was still analyzing his tools.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Throw me a line.” He yelled. She obeyed. Once had had a hook, he swung it
        around to a sizable peninsula above. “Now pull.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Gotcha!” She understood. If she heaved hard enough, he would be lifted to
        a vantage point wherein a single jump could thwart the obstacle. But after
        several attempts, he hadn’t been hoisted up at all.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “I said pull.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “I’m trying!” Zara put everything she had into it. She was pleased to see
        Boreas dragged a foot up, but with that, the neck holding the string gave
        out. Boreas’s full weight and Zara’s complete strength was too much for
        what turned out to be a loose but huge segment of boulders. The ensuing
        chain reaction was almost too much to bear.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Nomad and Selene stopped dead in their tracks, looking back to see a small
        mountain crumble in the distance, sending shockwaves throughout. She
        couldn’t possibly know her allies were to blame, and seeing how it lined up
        with another shrill shriek from the unknown Grimm, all assumed this
        incident to be the work of Grimm.

        <p>

        “What is that thing, again?” Selene had to stay on track just to keep up
        with Nomad’s pace.

        He didn’t even bother responding, believing the answer to be evident. One
        other would have interrupted him anyway. An anemic voice ricocheted off the
        walls, alerting everyone to a new presence. Selene choked, finding no help
        as Nomad whizzed away. His eyes narrowed and he was gone in a second. She
        didn’t even see him leave.

        Merlin hopped forward and growled, clearly outmatching the new threat. A
        bushel of members typical for this branch of the White Fang turned the tide
        though, funneling after their general. Selene saw the conflict play out,
        Merlin tackling enemy after enemy to temporarily disable them and buy her
        time to retreat. Herald <i>may</i> have had the agility to maneuver around
        and give chase, but his confidence held him back.
        <p>

    </p>
    <p>
        “When my friends come back here, you’re going to be in big trouble!” She
        threatened, beginning a simple departure.
        <p>
        </p>

        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>“No! Don’t let her get away, hraaagh!”</i>
        He skittered after her withdrawal with more men. The escape route was
        linear, leading right into a dark cave. Once Selene <i>and</i> Merlin were
        through, a bolt ruptured the entrance, starting a rockslide that locked her
        away from the White Fang. Making sure to stay out of view up until now,
        Nomad dropped in from the ceiling. Selene was grateful to have such a
        generous vanguard.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Thanks. Where did you go?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>“I couldn’t afford to be seen.”</i>
        He walked over to a shining tiara on the floor. She had somehow dropped it
        amidst the panic, rolling it over to Nomad. He picked it off the ground,
        examining it with unusual curiosity.
        <i>
            “Tell me about this headpiece.”
            <p>
            </p>
        </i>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Aha, it’s just for decoration.” She held her hand forward, expecting it
        back.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>“…No it isn’t.”</i>
        He gave a faint smile, complying despite his clear disagreement. She let
        out a nervous chuckle and quickly took it. They walked through the cove in
        nature’s silence, the occasional crack outside providing shafts of divine
        light.
        <i>
            “You won’t tell me about that tiara. How about that <b>girl?</b> The
            one guiding you last time.”
        </i>
        <p>
        </p>

    <p>
        “Oh, that’s Zara Haken!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Zara<i> Haken?” </i>He repeated, deliberating the word.
        <i>
            “Impossible. Her name is Zara <b>Tir.”</b>
            <p>

    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Zara <i>Tir?</i> No, you must be mistaken. Her last name is Haken, trust
        me. She’s really cool! She’s one of my friends from Beacon Academy.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
        “Oh, well, it’s a combat school where all the greatest warriors go to hone
        their skills!” Selene’s eyes sparkled. “Everyone is funneled into teams of
    four, and each get their own dorm room! Anyone who trains there is    <i>destined</i> to be a great hero!”
        <p>
        </p>

        <p>

        “We’re shown by teachers all the different things we need to know to become
        Huntsmen and Huntresses!”
        <p>

    </p>
    <p>
        <i>“I understand. Zara is your friend. What is <b>your</b> name?”</i>
        Nomad ceased the exploration, checking the surroundings.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “I’m <i>Selene Virtus,</i> the empress from Team <i>Lance!”</i> She flexed
        her arms.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>“Selene <b>Virtus?”</b></i>
        He paused. He couldn’t help but succumb to a cordial laugh.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “You don’t sound nearly as scary when you smile.” She snickered. Anytime he
        wasn’t scowling, he looked like a completely different person. Eventually
        they encountered a blockade with a series of magenta crystal pinned to it.
        She could already tell there was no feasible way to open it without great
        strength. <i>Nomad would have no trouble with it!</i> She was right.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        He unleashed an amethyst chunk to the door. Every one of the ornaments lit
        up with an ardent glow, and with that the path was clear.<i> </i>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “The <i>Beryl Rhinestone!”</i> Selene pointed at the key. “I-I need that!
        One of my friends dropped it!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>“Okay. I’ll trade one crystal for another. Give me the tiara.”</i>
        Nomad’s voice was as sinister as ever, but he must have been joking because
        he tossed her the Rhinestone right then and there.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>

        </p>

        What happened next wasn’t considered funny in the slightest to either of
        the two parties. A rocket-propelled locker fresh from Beacon Academy
        crashed through the ceiling, impaling itself many yards away from Nomad. He
        didn’t even flinch. Lucifer kicked down the door and trained a gun on the
        stranger.
        <p>
        </p>

    <p>

        <i>“Let her go!”</i>
        He barked.

    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Wait, Lucifer! This is just a misunderstanding! He’s here to help!” Selene
        was torn on who to hide behind.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>

        <i>
            “You may fire. But without me neither of you will <b>ever</b> leave
            this place.”
        </i>
        There wasn’t a trace of fear in Nomad’s voice. He wasn’t willing to
        validate the threat by turning around.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>

    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “You will.” He walked through the unbarred way, his cape-like coat catching
        the wind. He was gone, leaving them to work their way out on their own.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>

        <p>

        “He’s was helping me. he’s a friend!” Selene frowned.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “He’s a faunus, Selene. And not even counting <i>that,</i> he’s likely in
        the <i>White Fang</i>.” Despite their conflict, they were happy to see each
        other, nestling. Only due to their isolation, he undid his mask.
        <p>

        “He can’t be, he helped me get <i>away</i> from them. You must be
        mistaken.” Merlin backed her up by nodding.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Why are you <i>in</i> Summit’s Blight? I had to find out from Rade. I made
        it here as quickly as possible.” Lucifer let her go.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>

        “I was here to get the Rhinestone back, see?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “A <i>Rhinestone.</i> What are you talking about?” He took a closer look at
        the pearl.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>

    <p>
        “Boreas found it, but then he lost it, and now I’ve found it again! We came
        here to help him find more.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Boreas!? You’re telling me the leader of <i>Team Burnt</i> brought you
        here?” His anger mounted.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Um, yes?” She contemplated taking it back, realizing how much she just
        framed the alchemist. Boreas didn’t care though, he’d probably take the
        beating and read a book on the spot to get his mind off of the pain. At
        least that was the general approach employed when he fought <i>Grimm. </i>
        Such a farce was occurring on the other side of Summit’s Blight. Zara had
        greatly limited a wild Ursa’s mobility by ensnaring it in hooks, sure, but
        Boreas tanked all incoming hits anyway, waging a war of
        attrition that he knew he had the Aura to win.
        <i>
            <p>
            </p>
        </i>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Where’d you learn that technique? It’s like you’ve grown <i>accustomed</i>
        to suffering.” Zara mocked, shaking her head at the carnage.
        <p>

        </p>

    <p>
        “The best way to help my team without my mind is to <i>stand</i> in front
    of them. I’m hardly the worst of it though. You should see Team Burnt’s    <i>other</i> shield.” He cracked his knuckles. “But standing isn’t going to
        do anything here. I’d follow breadcrumbs, but I assure you I’ve seen that
        same rock design three times at this point. Now, applying what I know about
        Grimm hideouts and our encounters with them, and cross referencing that
        with the prognosis gathered by cloud formations, I can make a candid
        estimation that-”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “We’re totally lost, aren’t we?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “…an estimation that we’re lost, yes.” Boreas confirmed.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “We’ve been here too long. And we have no idea where Selene is. She could
        be <i>out</i> already, and how would we know?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Even if we did, <i>we</i> don’t know the way out. I can tell you where it
        isn’t, though. <i>That</i> way.” He beckoned the road already traversed.
        Given all the strange ploys so far, he could very possibly be wrong. Boreas
        was reconsidering his decision when the next room unveiled the popular
        White Fang. Going in the wrong direction may have been less trouble after
        all.
        <p>
        </p>

        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Zara and Boreas were absent in the White Fang’s affairs during their last
        adventure. Herald was completely new to them, but he proudly stood the path
        of a general, harnessed in the attire reflective of an
        evildoer.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>“What in the!? Why are there so many stragglers here!?”</i>
        Herald was growing tired of the constant intrusions, not that he could do
        anything about it. Zara began the fight with a simple combo in his
        direction. The rest of the White Fang simply guarded their master, until
        the time came to actively push his enemies back. For Boreas, this meant six
        or so grunts tackling him down. He wouldn’t fall to his knees, trying in
        vain to pull them off, but he did veer away from the battle ring- away from
        the main conflict.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
    “You! I know you. Get that girl back here, now!    <i>For the Arbiter, Kyadin Bael!”</i> Herald ordered. His men closed in,
        having experienced Team Lance’s justice but spared from Team Blazer’s.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “…Who?” Zara had only a moment to think of why these trained militants were
        following the commands of such a wimpy and frankly <i>weak</i> authority.
        She hadn’t a shred of any idea what or who he was talking about. He had to
        be hiding something.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The two sides learned eachother’s strength and weaknesses, exploiting them
        whenever possible. The numbers advantage couldn’t be topped, Zara only able
        to <i>defend</i> against the ten or so closing in. And <i>that</i> was a
        tall task. She was less than delighted to see ten <i>more</i> as
        collateral.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Flaming bombardments of barbed blades bounced from minion to minion, but it
        was a meaningless effort. These White Fang soldiers were of the same type
        as before, modified with red bandages, fighting with sheathed thorns. Zara
        could only fend them off, ultimately changing courses. Her nimble style let
        her evade the standard infantry, but the slick <i>Herald</i> couldn’t be
        outran.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Stop! Don’t run from me!” She could hear his pleas follow her into an
        isolated cave. She assumed he was all that was left. He would <i>have</i>
        to be if she wanted to get out of this alive, especially when taking into
        account the dead end. She was in a quarry coliseum with no way in nor out,
        not even from above. Deep water surrounded the borders, leaving a small
        path into the middle that went nowhere.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The aisle had a fair few big breaks, something both parties were adequate
        at crossing. Zara reached the end and turned, hooks in her hand. Herald
        presumably had a backup plan to have given chase and directed orders at all
        those troops without question.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Wait! You can’t run!” He tiptoed to her position, paranoid at a sudden
        attack.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Not from you.” She grumbled, siphoning fire into her hooks until embers
        drifted off of them. Zara had to pause though, as something well equipped
        and welcome intervened. It started with a hint of bubbles, then a hulking
        titan rose from the swamp. Herald was oblivious to it all.

    “You misunderstand! Erm, our loyalty rests with    <i>my Lor- <b>Drargh!”</b></i> Boreas stopped him, pummeling Herald in the
        side of the head with a baleful fist. The White Fang commander squealed,
        darting into the wall. His Aura was ruined in one hit.
        <p>

    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “The White Fang. What are they doing here?” Boreas cut to the chase,
        fencing him off from any escape with Zara bringing up the rear.
        <p>
        </p>

        “Ahem, err, we are not-” He couldn’t get to his feet on the slippery
        rubble.

        “Grrr!” Herald paused, his reinforcements arriving at long last. Boreas and
        Zara made the mistake of sizing up the new competition. Their line of site
        was broken with Herald for less than a second, more than enough time for an
        escape. Using the draft, he turned to paper, utilizing his semblance to get
        behind his battalion.

        “How did he!? <i>Impossible!”</i> Boreas stomped forward.
        <p>
        </p>

    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “R-Retreat! Leave them be!” The Estranged General mounted a withdrawal.
        Neither villain nor hero argued.

        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Yeah, you better run!” Zara cackled. One more hurdle cleared, hopefully
        their last. If only Lucifer and Selene were as prosperous.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>

        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Wait a minute!” Selene recognized her surroundings for once. How could she
        not, the <i>train tracks</i> from earlier couldn’t be missed. They were
        identicle. It was the same location, somehow replicated far from its
        origin. “I was here earlier. We’ve been going west for nearly ten minutes,
        how could we be running in circles?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “There’s something wrong with this place. Same as last time, it’s as though
        Summit’s Blight was sliced into little pieces and scrambled every few
        minutes. I can’t stand it.” Lucifer diagnosed. “And worst of all, Grimm
        everywhere.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Keep talking like that, you’ll only attract more.” Selene felt guilty for
        forcing this upon Lucifer but figured advice would never hurt.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Maybe it’ll be good practice.” On reaction a Boarbatusk boomed onto the
        scene in an explosion of debris, already spinning towards Lucifer. He
        cartwheeled away into the range of a Beowolf. A tussle of claws and fists
        set the wolf up to get slammed by the Boarbatusk. Predictability was a
        death sentence, one these young monsters didn’t yet comprehend.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Lucifer backed away from the fleshy shrapnel of the collision, bumping into
        Selene.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Oops! Sorry!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Don’t be. Instead, stay behind me!” He pulled her into position, noticing
        a horde of creeps nearby. Low health pools but high speeds and powerful in
        groups, Lucifer grasped the sort of trouble present. Assuming he wouldn’t
        miss, he counted <i>thirteen</i> shots.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The onslaught required him to dual-wield shotguns, but even with that
        buffer reloading was a strict requirement. With one creep left, he braced
        himself to endure its leap and keep it off of Selene. Once the brawl was
        taken to the ground, wrestling with it wouldn’t have been fun.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Nothing happened. A projectile of some sort zoomed past the duo into the
        Grimm, puncturing it behind a rack of slabs. Lucifer turned to seek the
        source, groaned, and aimed one of the guns at the rescuer.
        <p>

        Nomad had finished off the skirmish, seemingly watching the entire time.
        <p>

    </p>
    <p>
        <p>

        “C’mon, let him help us!” Selene pulled on Lucifer’s cape, whispering
        despite experiencing firsthand Nomad’s intense ability to eavesdrop.

        “Lucifer! Remember the whole Maximus thing? You said you’d try.” She
        begged. He looked down into her eyes, the tables somehow turning. He
        couldn’t stand that look.
        <p>

        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “On one condition. Neither of you are to return to this place.” Nomad was
        already roaming away, a silent invitation for them to watch his footsteps.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Ever?” Selene asked.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>“Ever.”</i>
        He repeated. To embolden his conviction, the now named Galathyn marked its
        presence with another clamor of screaming. The holler was impossible to get
        used to.
        <p>

        “Is it because of the White Fang? Are they too dangerous?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>

        “Yes.” His response was quick.

        “How come you’re so familiar with Summit’s Blight?” She probed, simply
        making small talk. No explanation came forth. A sequence of grueling hikes
        in silence took them to the bottom of a chasm. For the first time, there
        was nowhere to go but up. Two steep cliffs shot straight up on either side
        of them, making it clear that they were in fact settled in a damp ravine.
        How they ended up there, Lucifer was unsure, almost dumbfounded. Nomad
        pulled them into a tall crevice at the sound of dialogue further down the
        abyss.
        <p>

        “What is that? They’re not with you are they?” He snarled, seeing two
        mercenaries searching ahead.

        “No, it’s… <i>Servus Portum.”</i> Lucifer couldn’t believe his eyes. A pair
        of gunners plucked straight from the red city had ventured inside the
        labyrinth, the smog still lingering on them.
        <p>
        </p>

        “Purifiers sent from Caligula, ruler of a rising kingdom in the north.
        Highly trained, deadly efficient. He claimed the White Fang was his enemy,
        and that Vale has staved off any sort of alliance with his great desire to
        conquer. Wait!” Lucifer started a briefing, not yet able to fully outline
        the dangers ahead before Nomad walked out to approach them.

        <i>“You will stop where you stand, faunus scum.” </i>
        One of the Servus Sentries targeted Nomad, who to everyone’s surprise
        complied.

        although as usual his voice didn’t match his face.

        </p>

        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Nomad looked back at Lucifer in a mixture of disbelief and bewilderment,
        the teenagers hidden from view. “Whatever you’re looking for, you’ve come
        to the wrong place. Tell this <i>Caligula</i> there is nothing worth
        seeking here. <i>He should move on.”</i>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>

            “Supreme Leader Caligula acts of his own accord! As do we. Blasphemy
            towards a Servus Official is punishable by <b>death.”</b>
        </i>
        They fired upon him, condemning on the Blight’s iconic beholder a hailstorm
        of napalm. Nomad was <i>unconcerned,</i> whipping the curtain of his jacket
        forward to shield his entire body. Somehow it absorbed any incoming damage.
        This effortless display of basic defensive skill opened up a chance for
        Lucifer to return fire. In the wake of a needed reload, he pounced into the
        fray.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Nomad dared not intervene, watching Lucifer trade blows with one of the
        gunmen. Neither could truly deal with the other, but if the one-one-one was
        tipped in favor of Servus Portum, a victor would be earned quickly. Thus
        Merlin meddled as per usual, knocking over the other Purifier and raining
        down a series of paw-slams. Still, Servus Portum showcased only the best,
        and with a bit of perseverance the tides shifted.
        <p>

        </p>

        He held out his crossbow. Not once had Nomad done anything in a fight other
        than pull a trigger. Obviously his aim was laudable, but even if that was
        all he’d shown off thus far, it was more than Selene offered. The repeater
        had three bolts loaded at once, each one having the power to immediately
        incapacitate most opponents. Selene missed all three.

        He crouched down, dispensed ammunition, and guided her aim- directing her
        arm. He led the target for several seconds, noticing the extra finesse that
        came with focusing her intent rather than his own. “Fire.”

        She did as commanded, and with his help the arrow pierced one of the
        enemies’ armor. Savoring his freedom, Lucifer rushed to Merlin’s side and
        ceased the fight with comparative ease.

        exploring more traditional dens.

        With the newfound knowledge of the maze’s behavior, Selene and Lucifer
        could at least understand how Nomad was navigating, but they weren’t even
        close to being able to do it on their own. His choices appeared random, and
        Lucifer almost swore Nomad finally made a wrong turn when they were
        deadlocked at an empty grotto.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        But the faunus couldn’t accept that, squinting at every corner. “We’re
        close to the end, of that I’m certain. One right move it all it takes. Same
        for a wrong move, too.” It was in fact the case that he needed Selene and
        Lucifer, because with <i>them</i> came Merlin. His natural sense of
        direction rewarded the group.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “What is it, little guy?” Selene followed his steps, entranced by his
        pawing at the wall. One push and it collapsed in a flurry of toppling
        stones.
        <i>
            “Ah!”
            <p>
            </p>
        </i>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Maybe we don’t need you after all.” Lucifer brushed past his guide. Nomad
        wasn’t too bothered with the idea. A new hidden passage was uncovered, and
        not a moment too soon. Not only were they rewarded with the exit, but their
        classmates. Boreas and Zara were reunited with their friends.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
    “Selene! Lucifer?” The faunus with horns lit up, but the faunus with    <i>antlers</i> disappeared, bailing on the situation as was his nature. No
        longer needed, and with the threat of meeting somebody new, Nomad departed
        with speed so quick nobody even saw him. The breeze was the only indication
        he was there at all. In all the excitement, nobody noticed.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Zara! Finally!” Selene revered.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “You!” Lucifer pointed at Boreas, trudging up to the conflicting team
        leader.
        <i>
            “You brought Selene here, put us all through this, and for <b>what?</b>
            A
            <b>
                Rhinestone!?”
                <p>
                </p>
            </b>
        </i>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Where is it? You’ve seen it?” Boreas cared not for the intimidation play,
        naturally being taller. Lucifer pulled it out, not able to speak before it
        was snatched away. “Yes! With this, we can finally leave!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “We could have left anyway, you fool!” Lucifer’s insults resumed.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “It’s not a big deal! We’re alright!” Selene ran up between the two,
        whispering. “What have we been talking about? Just calm down!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Ugh. Just… don’t let it happen again. Let’s get out of here before I get
        more of a headache.” His decree was met with zero contention, meaning the
        objective was for once as easily done as it was said. To sweeten the cake,
        Team Lance’s other half happened to be waiting at the entrance of Beacon by
        coincidence.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Nadia! We just got back from Summit’s Blight.” Lucifer ran up with a
        barebones explanation. The confusion could be seen on her face alone. “Long
        story short, Selene got lost.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “What happened!? Did she get hurt? W-Was the White Fang there?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “I don’t know. Zara told me she fought one of their generals while we were
        returning, and I suspect one of its dwellers may be among them. It sickens
        me to think I may have actually received help from one of them.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Just leave it at that, please. I-I’m sorry. I don’t need to hear about how
        you guys took out a bunch of partisan faunus in Summit’s Blight
        <i>
            again.”
            <p>
            </p>
        </i>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Don’t be silly, they had what was coming to them-“
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Please, just, get on with it.” Nadia rushed him along, fearing another
        confrontation.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “I’ll fill you in once I get my strength back but… I was wondering if you
        could help train Selene on how to use her semblance.” Asking for help
        wasn’t in his nature.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Oh, I’d love to, but I was about to stop by Augustus. I was hoping I’d be
        able to do so before it gets dark. I’m sorry.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
    “…But you use your semblance all the time. Who else can teach her? I just    <i>really</i> need her to be able to defend herself before something bad
        happens again.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “I’m really sorry, but I can’t. I have to go check to see if Ella has
        remembered anything else. I promised her. You should meet her sometime like
        I’ve been saying, she’s super nice-“
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Whatever.” Lucifer walked out on her. He cared not for Nadia’s desperate
        look back nor her decision to leave regardless, now believing her
        compatriot unable to please.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Hey! What was that about? You didn’t have to go so hard on her.” Alecto
        stopped him.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “She’ll survive. What about you? Surely you can help Selene train her
        semblance, right?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Me? I hardly use my semblance, how could I do it? Can’t you teach her?”
        She testified. Questions were par for the course.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “The few times you did use your powers, it was impressive. And I can’t
    quite teach a semblance, mine doesn’t work like the sort you    <i>activate.</i> As much as I hate to admit, I’m unfamiliar with this sort
        of thing. I need your help.” Lucifer crossed his arms.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “You, Lucifer, are asking for <i>my</i> help? Aww, how cute!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Shut it! You know I’m no good at this stuff!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “But I’m right, aren’t I? Hmmm?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “…Yes. Help me. Help Selene. I can’t do this on my own.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
    “Alright, then! When do you wish to start? Or rather, when do you want    <i>her</i> to start? Right now?” She laid her hand on the hilt of her
        sword, now excited at the thought of sparring.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Affirmative.” He offered a handshake.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “What is this, a business venture? I’m not your personal-servant-monkey.
        Would it kill you to show more affection sometime, like a hug?” She
        snorted, already leaving towards the Combat Hall.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        “It might.” Lucifer scorned. He, bidding farewell to Boreas and Zara, took
        Selene with him to the far reaches of Beacon’s training grounds. It would
        be there that their practice began, with or without Nadia.
