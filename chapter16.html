    “I’ve brought with me the equivalent of a four-hundred sticks of dynamite.”
    Augustus boasted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What’s that for? A midnight snack?” Nero grumbled at his own joke,
    checking the time whilst browsing dust that could be sold off for ten-times
    its price.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Keep playing with your toy, and it might take that long.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s not a <i>toy,</i> actually. This is <i>business.” </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’ll have to disrupt the assembly line, then.” Augustus activated his
    weapon without lifting it from his back, zapping Nero’s scroll and frying
    it instantly.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“What the hell!? Grah!”</i>
    He juggled it to the floor, where it exploded into a pool of shiny puzzle
    pieces. He didn’t seem to mind <i>too</i> much, as in his cape six more
    were hidden. Purchased for cheap, there was no discrediting his plan to use
    them in turning a hefty profit. “You’ll pay for that!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Ella, just as familiar with the dilapidated cave system, hid behind both of
    them. “Guys? Are you sure this is the right way?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Of course. Has to be. Boreas and I had forged these paths many times.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How many?” Augustus had his doubts.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Me, specifically? Once.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A shadow appeared past the scaffolding of a bridge, then the <i>stilts</i>
    of a bridge. <i>Then</i> the <i>walkway</i> of a bridge. Really, it was
    more of a <i>complete</i> bridge where this lurid figure faded out of the
    fog. Then, the shape spoke. “He’s correct on this one. Me and the rest of
    Team Blazer went in and out of here more times than I care to admit.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Zara? About time you finally joined the cause. How do we reach them?
    Quickly. There’s a chance we may end this here and now. How long has it
    been? For those trapped inside, this is a true trial for survival. Not from
    Grimm, necessarily, because none of my trackers are picking up much of
    anything. But to be able to survive this many sun downs in the wilderness
    is impressive in its own right!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Zara tried to ease his concern as she overtook Nero as the pathfinder.
    “There’s a travelling merchant in there who likes to follow us. His name is
    Troy. From my short time there, he was the main source of food, and he
    never ran out. As for water, there’s a pasture labeled the <i>Meridian</i>
    with plenty of safe drinking water. I always boiled it just to be sure, but
    Boreas can probably just <i>purify</i> it.” Her thoughts turned to Servus
    Portum’s
    <i>
        Purifiers.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “And what about Nobody? Really think they can hold out against <i>him?”</i>
    He challenged her optimism, still basing his efforts in the name of a lie
    that the Grimm Tactician was the cause of everything.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Here’s the entrance. See? Nothing can break through.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If I nuke this wall with <i>state-of-the-art</i> explosives imported by
    General Uriel, it’ll give in. Right?” Augustus questioned.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I guess. Isn’t it sort of against the rules, though? You’re supposed to
    use the <i>Beryl Rhinestone.”</i> Zara argued.
    <i>
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I had to wait longer than I’d prefer for you to show me Terra Insanire, so
    I just had Slick here give me directions, thanks.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “My name is not <i>‘Slick’,</i> you moron.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Augustus disabled another one of Nero’s scrolls and continued. “Point is, I
    heard you exhausted all possibilities on Aamon’s passage inside during that
    time. Did you figure it out? <i>No.</i> These bombs are the next best
    thing.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Let me see if there’s anything to indicate otherwise.” Nero left, sulking
    deeper into the mine.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Wait! This door… Look at all these markings.” Ella kneeled down to
    appreciate how immaculate the stone work was, with pure blue light wedging
    outward from the carvings. “I… I feel like I’ve seen them before.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This excited Augustus a great deal. “Where? <i>When?</i> Are you
    remembering something?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-I think I am!” She smiled, a rarity without the assistance of Nadia.
    “M-My last name! It’s-”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“You thought you made it out…”</i>
    It was then they noticed. A man was <i>watching.</i> He was quite content
    with snooping in the darkness for a time, but now he marched forward.
    <i>
        “You thought you’d slipped past the broad influence of my teachings,
        and the limitless gaze of my eye…”
    </i>
    His boots became visible in the light, though even as he approached, his
    identity could not be pinpointed.
    <i>
        “But you’ll learn soon enough, that the reach of Servus Portum
        surpasses its borders.”
    </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>Victor.</i>
    Worse yet, hiding behind him was Aamon, who was holding <i>Terrance</i> by
    a leash.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Augustus tilted his head, unsure of whether he should feel disgust, or
    excitement. <i>“You!</i> Where’s your master? Too afraid to show himself?
    Instead he has to send his <i>dogs</i> to do all the work.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, quite the contrary! Supreme Leader Caligula has his hands busy in
Summit’s Blight, with foes <i>far</i> more pivotal than you. No,    <i>you’ll</i> be finished here and now.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Aamon! Let Terrance go. He plays no part in this.” Zara ordered.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well, actually, even as a faunus, I must thank him.” Victor’s grin grew in
size with every twist. “I’m afraid this animal is no longer on your side.    <i>He</i> came to <i>us,</i> and willingly showed the way right to you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You really think we’ll eat up your lies?” Augustus countered calmly.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It would be wise not to question General Victor.” Aamon remarked. “This
    faunus sought us out, and in return for information regarding the location
    of <i>Ella</i> and <i>Zara Tir,</i> we’ve bargained not to kill him.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He’s telling the truth.” Zara quaked at the thought of a close friend
turning on her. “Aamon can’t lie. He can <i>never</i> lie. Terrance,    <i>why? </i>How could you do this to us?”
    <i>
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Y-You don’t understand.” He sighed. “I have no choice! Just myself isn’t
    enough anymore! If I do not stop Ella, none of us will survive.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Stop me from doing what? Why can’t you just leave me alone?!” She cried
    out.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…I wish I could.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“I’m talking!”</i>
Victor silenced every faunus in the dripping den.    <i>“I’m talking! I want <b>complete</b> quiet! </i>Aamon. Cut them off. I
    will deal with the Warden. As for <i>you!”</i> He hissed in Terrance’s
    face. “Get Ella back here, <i>now!</i> Don’t fail me, or I’ll bring the
    hammer down.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Aamon and Zara grappled with each other until they tumbled through a wall,
    isolating the fight that was assumed to resume. Ella scrambled away, not
    ready mentally nor physically to put up any defense against Terrance, who
    pursued vigorously. That left Victor and Augustus, who stared each other in
    the eye despite both having some form of cover to muddle their faces. It
    was either glasses, or shade.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We’re not in your regal little city anymore. You have zero jurisdiction
    here.” Augustus pointed out.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Maybe, maybe. But Caligula has his sights set on Vale. I don’t question
    it. I’m here to put the <i>faunus</i> under lock and key, in perfect shape
    for his arrival. Get in my way, you get in <i>his</i> way. For what reason
    would the greatest and most prosperous kingdom in all of Remnant fear one
    lone curator and his mockery of a prison? <i>Now,</i> back down.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…The Administrator will have your head for this. You are under arrest.
    Understand? Your crusade is over, do you hear me?
    <i>
        Your crusade is
        <b>
            over!”
            <p>
            </p>
        </b>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Augustus flew forward with his sword drawn. But Victor was more versatile
    than he let on, and the only one who’d witnessed his teleportation
    techniques, <i>Zara,</i> was gone. He danced circles around Augustus,
    granted he had to admire the skill of his enemy. Neither could breach the
    other’s defense.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The situation boiled over when one pretended to miss their sword strike,
    feigning to then grab Victor by the neck. On the floor the tyrannical chief
    fell, only to be thrown by his leg into the door of Terra Insanire. He had
    taken solace in watching Vale’s heroes, but he’d dismissed how they’d
    planted stacks of napalm at the very gate he stood at. Augustus used the
    detonator to ignite a pyramid of nasty, volatile charges. The vibrations
    could be felt by all. Even Zara and Aamon, who faked a skirmish to talk in
    private, weren’t spared.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Wow. Must be some fight. Do you know what caused that? Not another one of
    Victor’s tricks, right?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I cannot anticipate.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Why not?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Aamon scanned every shard of sharp rock and stray vine within sight as he
    raved about his origin. “When Aamon <i>‘AA0001’ </i>was constructed by
Victor, Supreme Leader Caligula stripped us of the ability to    <b>anticipate.</b> We are unable to foresee what will happen next, as we
    cannot predict the next move in this period of war, nor the strikes that
    come with combat.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “And you’re all clones, right? So that means none of the Purifiers have
    foresight?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Correct. But we do have something far more valuable, something Supreme
    Leader Caligula overlooked. <i>Hindsight.</i> Thus, you see the battle of
    attrition Aamon has been forced to lead with. Supreme Leader Caligula could
    take away almost <i>everything,</i> but not the ability to learn.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>

    Everything around Zara disappeared as she focused intensely on his words,
    trying to formulate any sort of strategy against Caligula. “Why did he do
    all this?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “To figure it out, Aamon would be required to anticipate. Anticipate
    Supreme Leader Caligula’s motives. It is beyond our comprehension.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Is it possible he did it to prevent an uprising from you? I mean, think
    about it. No matter how much you <i>plan</i> and <i>plan,</i> he would
always have the perfect weapon to take you out. And <i>another,</i> and    <i>another.</i> Remember, you can’t lie, either. I think everything he’d
    done was meant to rule out the possibility of mutiny.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The machine clacked his fingers together, soaking in the wonders of free
    thought and possibility. “If what you say is true, he <i>will</i> have the
    perfect weapon. Whether or not he’ll have multiple, Aamon still cannot
    anticipate. But perfection is fleeting and eventually, like any force that
    stands against Servus Portum, Supreme Leader Caligula will run out of ways
to kill us. And then, Aamon’s victory will be ever imminent. There is    <b>no</b> war we cannot win.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I know. That’s why I’m thankful you’re with <i>us.”</i> Zara began heating
    her hooks, hoping to get this briefing over with and return to the warzone.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You have enlightened Aamon on the possibility of our Supreme Leader’s
    treachery. If you have <i>anything</i> else to report on the matter, it can
    only help you. Do so now.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well, if we’re talking about taking him out, I have plenty to report,
    sure.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It is not our orders to kill Supreme Leader Caligula, nor stand idle as he
    is insulted. Defamation of a Servus Official is punishable by death.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s protocol, right? Same goes for capturing Ella, I’m guessing?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Correct.” Aamon nodded. “If I had not gone after Ella, it may have
    violated policy. I know from experience that such an act would be met with
    suspicion. Victor cannot discover my attempts at subterfuge.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Zara smiled. “So you <i>are</i> trying to overthrow him. You aim to
    collapse Servus Portum?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Aamon<i> ‘AA0001’</i> is planning a revolution. That’s why it’s such a
    victory that I’ve found <i>you,</i> Zara Tir. You will be my greatest
    weapon against Supreme Leader Caligula.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So you actually recognized me as an ally all this time. Was it the hooks
that gave away my ties to <i>‘Servus City’, </i>or did you know something    <i>else?”</i> Zara <i>hated</i> her hooks, even if there was no plausible
    way to get rid of them or fend off enemies without the pronged incisors,
    which stared back at her with flickering reflections.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Aamon<i> ‘AA0001’, </i>prior to his evolution, always had exceptional
    Aura-reading abilities. When you first entered Servus Portum, he identified
    you from your Aura.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Just like Nomad… And what’s with the name <i>‘Tir’?</i> You and him both
    call me that. That <i>isn’t</i> my name!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Away from them, shadows from Zara’s determined light were formed to create
    the shapes of terrible Grimm. “Yes, it <i>is.</i> You were born in Servus
Portum as Zara Tir, even if it’s a name you forsake now. It was I who    <i>saved your life,</i> and cast you away at a young age. There was a
    chance Supreme Leader Caligula would kill you, but you’re too valuable for
my goals to risk anything. Don’t bother asking me why because I don’t    <i>know</i> why. I just <i>know.</i> Back then, Aamon was still fully
    human. Our transition into these bodies left gaps in our memories.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…” Nothing more was shared between the two, that was until further rumbles
    leftover from Augustus’s tumultuous outburst came. “One more question. How
    did you get into Terra Insanire?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I took a shortcut through the <b>Bone Graveyard.</b> Meet me in Servus
    Portum, at the burial site of the same name, and I’ll show you. Now,
    there’s something from <i>you</i> I need.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Kill me. Aamon<i> ‘AA0001’ </i>wants zero record of this conversation to
    exist.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Gotcha!”</i>
    Nero crashed onto the scene, knocking over pyramids of stone and formations
    untouched for years to make sure zero debris separated him from his target.
    Every spiked sphere of his flail packed malice, all of it culminating to
    behead Aamon. “It’s alright, Zara, I took care of him! He won’t be hurting
    you <i>anytime</i> soon!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t think he was hurting anyone. He wasn’t even putting up a fight.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So you’re telling me there’s no lien reward?” In rhythm with his verbal
    scrounging for riches, he smacked Aamon’s limp body over and over.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t even dream of it. C’mon! Augustus may need our help!” Zara grabbed
    his hand, and pulled him past the several walls she kindly asked Aamon to
    break through so they may create the illusion of a catastrophic struggle.
    But for as deep as they considered themselves inside the ingress of Terra
    Insanire, there was one other who’d accidently ventured to the point of
    obscenity. Ella had high hopes that switching this way and that through the
    soggy catacombs would deter Terrance. At this point, she dodged that fate,
    but had doomed herself to one potentially far worse.

    Not all was lost, even if she <i>was.</i> A performance of digital
    chirping, along with the blossom offered from numerous computer screens had
drawn Ella out into the open, into the dimness always indicative of    <i>an Oathkeeper clad in bloody rags.</i>

    Ella tried walking forward, as she believed her new peer’s insistence on
    turning away an act of passive disinterest. <i>She</i> would’ve been
    enamored with all the flickering screens, and virtual popups. “He’s the
only thing I remember from my past life. W-Wait a minute! You have the    <i>Beryl Rhinestone?”</i> She spotted it among the mess of holograms.

    Augustus activated the bombs. He had caused a tragic blast worthy of
    demolishing everything <i>but</i> the target. Not only was the door somehow
    untouched by even a <i>dent,</i> but so was <b>Victor,</b> who laughed as
    he strolled out of the smoke.
    <i>
        “Impossible! That was the best Atlas had to offer.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Rahahahahaha!</i>
    That’s <i>child’s play</i> compared to what I’ve been exposed to back east.
If you’re willing to give it, you must be willing to <b>take</b> it. I    <i>live</i> by that statute, and let me be clear. There is nothing you can
    do to me I haven’t done to <i>myself</i> in preparation!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Augustus hadn’t given up yet, but his spirit took a dive at seeing how much
    dexterity Victor had to work with. “You’ve trained your Aura against your
    own weapons to steel yourself up!? That’s
    <i>
        insane!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No! That’s <i>warfare!” </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Metal clashed with fist, Victor’s Aura somehow resilient enough to push
    through barrages what would’ve disemboweled Grimm ten-times his size. He
    favored himself ranged combat, but first he needed to put distance between
    himself and Augustus. Only a series of acrobatic kicks would suffice.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Using his pistol, which took maximum advantage of Servus Portum
    engineering, he rained hell down upon the specter. Dodging only did so
    much, and when Augustus tried to take cover, Victor zoomed behind him.
    Positioning him on the ground was a waste of time so long as Augustus
    possessed the gift of flight, so he held him up by his neck instead,
    strangling him.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Stop!</i>
    Fight, and it’ll only be more painful!” Victor taunted, jerking his hands
    this way and that to guarantee Augustus lost consciousness. He stopped,
    though, concerned when the hellish fumes that kept Augustus afloat became
    unruly. The pungent gas that replaced everything from his waist down began
    slithering outward to form a <i>sphere</i> on the ceiling.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Not yet!” </i>
    Victor spun his classic Mauser onto the blinkers of Augustus and fired,
    forcing them apart. Just as predicted, the glasses slid out of Augustus’
    reach. There was an unforeseen bonus, as the sword and portal met the same
    fate. Now blinded, all the Warden could hear were arrogant footsteps, and
    the scraping of metal as Victor picked up his own sword.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “A defense of faunus is something I ultimately cannot allow. Don’t let this
    defeat haunt you. Vale will thrive under <i>my</i> rule.” Victor assured,
    smirking as Augustus scrambled to find his eye-wear. He assumed that was
    the objective. But Augustus couldn’t care less about those useless snippets
    of tinted glass. He longed for, and indeed <i>found,</i> his scroll.
    One button press, and the bout was over.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The handle of the sword, which was being tightly brandished by Victor,
    erupted into an array of sparks and electricity. Arcs of the erratic light
    showered everywhere, and completely overtook the Servant. Fickle bolts
    discharged in and out of him, rupturing his Aura and continuing to further
    rake him with claws of crackling lightning.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“You…”</i>
    He slipped to the ground and dropped the blade. “How <i>dare</i> you!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Victor may have stuck around for more preaching, but at the first sign of
    Zara’s return, he thought it best to limp away. No doubt Augustus couldn’t
    do anything to stop him, but there was no forgetting the expertise Zara
    showed last time they met.
    <i>
        “This isn’t a retreat. It’s preparation for future victories…”

        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Looking for these?” Zara quelled Augustus’ groping by handing him the
    glasses outright.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Thank you. He got away. I-I couldn’t see.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“It’s alright. Based off what I heard, I don’t think he’ll be coming back. <i>What happened here?</i> When we get the teams back, they won’t    <i>believe</i> the state of this place. Good news is, Aamon’s gone.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You can thank me for that!” Nero deviously rubbed his hands together. “I’m
    guessing that guy had a hefty bounty on him, right? Where do I sign for
    cash? Must’ve been one-of-a-kind,
    <i>
        no?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Um, actually, I think there may be more Aamons than any other species.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The stomping of another dire force drew groans from Augustus, who regained
    his territory within the skies and wiped dust from his sword. “What now-
    what, <i>now!?</i> Is this some sort of joke? Did every scoundrel in
    Remnant decide to invade Terra Insanire today?” It was just Ella. Augustus
    had never been as grateful to be so off the mark. “Ella! You’re okay!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>

<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Terrance?” Nero stroked his chin. “He was here, too? That’s
    <i>

<p>
    Ella gulped, unfamiliar with the art of lying. “I outran him. He’s lost
    somewhere deep in that direction. I-I found my way back on my own.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>

    <i>“Outstanding.</i>
    Now <b>half</b> my Team’s disappeared as a result of this tomfoolery.”

</p>
<p>
    “He deserved as much.” Augustus finally had a moment to relent, huffing in
    exhaustion. “The <i>fool</i> turned us in to Caligula’s right hand man.
    What could push him, as honest an ally as he was, to do such a thing?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He did it to get to me.” Ella admitted. “I don’t understand what he wants.
    No matter what I do or say, he insists that he knew me in the past.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Then as much as I hate to admit it, he’s too valuable to dismiss. When I
    find him, he’s taking a trip to the Crypt, where he’ll stay for as long as
    it takes.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Slow down.” Nero stepped in his way, preventing him from mounting any sort
    of search. “I don’t doubt today’s hardships are a result of Terrance’s poor
    judgement, but he is still my teammate, and friend. There is nothing to be
    gained from hunting him down. The most important mission is getting into
    Terra Insanire.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “P-Plus, I don’t think you’re going to find him…” Ella tried to keep anyone
    from wasting their time, searching endlessly for someone who had long since
been warped away. “It’s too dark. I only made it out because I… I    <i>glow.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So… What now? Apparently, the door can’t be <i>blown up. </i>That
    basically rules out every plan I had.” Augustus whined.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I have an idea.” Zara raised her hand. “When I had Aamon on the ropes, and
    before I passed him to be <i>obliterated</i> by Nero, I took advantage of
his inability to lie. Apparently, he made it to Terra Insanire through the    <i>‘Bone Graveyard.’</i> I could go there and check it out.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “But if it’s in Servus Portum, it’s suicide. <i>I</i> need to make sure
    nothing happens to Ella. She’s been gathering quite a bit of attention.
    You’d better take reinforcements. Besides myself, who’s left fit for
    infiltration?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’d <i>love</i> to get even.” Nero slapped the club of his flail against
his hand, craving a chance to cut down more Purifiers. “I could even get    <i>Maximus</i> to join the club. The three of us should have no problem
    turning rags to riches. Servus Portum won’t know what hit ‘em.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Fine. Begin preparations. I’ll have a bullhead ready by morning.”
    Augustus was already hovering away, trying to process the ludicrous set of
events that had taken place.    <i>“Hold on a little longer, Blazer and Lance. Soon.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Much had been expended in hopes of breaking into Terra Insanire. Inside,
    things were <i>much</i> worse. Completely splintered without any knowledge
    concerning each other’s whereabouts, and accursed to scavenge for supplies
    in the times they weren’t resting within trees or ditches to capture a wink of sleep,
    regret coerced through the desperate factions. Current arrangements were
    far from satisfactory. Especially for Beleth, who laid amongst the east end
    of the Meridian, humming.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I miss hearing you play. Why don’t you try out the violin every once in a
    while?” Lexy entered the hideout through a canopy of vines, the only
    indication of a sunset being the rays of orange light seeping through the
    green curtain.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m not feeling it, sorry. Besides, it might give away our position.”
    Beleth faked a smile. Now that his secret was out, there was no reason to
    wear his blindfold.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I brought you some food. All Troy had was candy bars this time. Wouldn’t
    tell me where he got them.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Thanks.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…You shouldn’t feel scared of Alecto.” Lexy dropped the snack and walked
    over to him. He stopped singing. “She can’t hurt you while I’m here. And
    she’s the only one who <i>wants</i> to. The rest of Lance is just
    protecting her. They want to get out of this just as much as we do.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “And what about Rade, or Zara? They’ve both fled my side in one way or
    another. I’m supposed to be their team leader, and I don’t even know where
    they
    <i>
        are.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Zara’s going to find a way to get us out of here. No doubt about it.” Lexy
    insisted. “Rade’s with Nadia and Selene. They’ve formed a council of sorts,
    trying to keep the peace. He hasn’t abandoned us. In fact, Selene mentioned
    that he had somehow gotten in Terra Insanire without the Rhinestone.
    Remember? Lucifer had it, and went to go look for Rade the day this all
    started.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Beleth looked away, searching for any recollection to support this claim.
    “Oh… Yeah! Rade knows how to get in and out of here! Then what’s he doing?
    What’s the secret?!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “When we tried to figure it out, he said a girl named <b>Lillian</b> opened
    the door for him. He’s probably lying. But it might be a lead, all things
    considered.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“…Lillian?”</i>
    Beleth looked up at her inquisitively. He almost got another word out, but
    a stream of pebbles clinked against his shoulder. He looked over at them,
    then stared straight up to see a foreign maiden watching, back pressed
    against the rocky roof.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Now!”</i>
    Alecto tackled Lexy out of the lair down a meadow, making sure Eleanor had
    to deal with only a Delphic. She wouldn’t <i>dare</i> lay a finger on
    anyone else, human and faunus alike. She dropped down, underestimating
    Beleth’s ability to cartwheel out of her stab and get a handle on his bow.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t know who you are, but you’d better walk away. Whatever Alecto told
    you, it couldn’t be worth death.” He braced his instruments against this
    new competitor.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Delphic. It is over. You now stand in the face of Eleanor, renowned
Grimm slayer and ancient master of <b>Tormentyst,</b> chosen by Lady        <b>Clotho</b> herself. Lay down your weapons, and sacrifice yourself to
        me as is your destiny.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Okay. Goodbye.” Beleth opened his show with an untamed performance of
    energy bursts that had proven most effective in taking down every variation
    of Grimm in the past. Eleanor flipped this way and that, moving in a way
    such that nothing even grazed her. The most Beleth’s withering projectiles
    could do was shine light off her effervescent armor. And her majestic
    blade, while certainly within limits to cut Beleth’s violin in half, was
    more than sufficient for disarming him.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    It took every ounce of willpower and effort for Beleth to keep up with his
    bow alone. And to make matters worse, he dreaded what would happen if the
    wooden portion of the sickle met that sinister blade.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Finally, Eleanor whipped everything out of his hands. No more vaunts of ego
    remained, instead replaced with fear as Beleth ran as far away as he was
    allowed within the confines of this cramped cave. Eventually cornered, he
    flinched as Eleanor shoved Tormentyst forward to stab him through the chest.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Negative.”</i>
    A hand darted out of the darkness, somehow stopping Eleanor at the wrist
    through the element of surprise.
    <i>
        “That’s not going to happen.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Eleanor looked over and gasped, two red pupils latching over an obscured
face. Regardless, the commando stared daggers through her and    <i>twisted,</i> forcing Eleanor to drop her sword.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Lucifer!?” Beleth couldn’t believe what he was seeing. Alecto’s most
    trusted companion, and head of Team Lance, wasn’t just <i>trying</i> to
    save him- he was forcing Eleanor back with decisive chops and <i>unseen</i>
    footwork.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “N-No!” Eleanor was untouchable with Tormentyst, but challenging Lucifer
    bare-handed was a grave mistep. Not that she ever would. “I cannot duel
another unless they’re a Grimm!    <i>You mean to fight me when I have no way of attacking back!? Ah!”</i> She
    was kicked into the smothering heat of a dying sun.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Just keeping the peace is all. Can’t let you kill Beleth. Even as a
    Delphic, he has much left to do for Remnant.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I would be cast off by Lady Clotho if I ever fought back against you. It
    violates our principles. Stand aside, child. You know not the evil you
    defend.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer leaned his head to the side, this line of reasoning somewhat
    curious to him. “Affirmative. Beleth’s different. But I knew him for
    months, and I’ve never doubted his purity. I’ll be sure to <i>pummel</i>
    him later for his crimes, but I won’t have you or anyone <i>kill</i> him.
    You’re a friend of Alecto, I presume?” He held his hand out.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    She paused, then accepted his handshake. Now ensued the trickery. Lucifer
    vaulted an unprepared Eleanor overhead, down a cliff. He then cautiously
    walked away, deliberating the severity of this action while checking the
    time.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto and Lexy tried everything within their limited toolset to knock the
    other out, all while breaking a trail of carnage through the steep,
    normally tranquil woods. Completely dismissing footing, they rolled out of
    the Meridian into an increasingly ravenous canyon.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Just <b>had</b> to get in the way <i>again!”</i> Alecto snarled. “But it
    doesn’t matter! Lady Eleanor is stronger than you or I, and she won’t
    hesitate to finish this!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Despite this premature exhibition of achievement, she began to worry not
    about Beleth, but <i>herself.</i> Unfortunately, the ride ended with her
    taking a majority of the fall, and now Lexy was in the perfect position to
    batter her.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Why! Won’t! You! Just! Leave! Us! <b>Alone!”</b></i>
    She finished off each word with a punch to Alecto’s mask. Lucifer tugged
    her away before she could do any <i>real</i> damage. Not to Alecto, but to
    her suit. He could only imagine how drastic the scrimmage would’ve become
    if <i>that</i> happened.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Enough! Are you two out of your mind!?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Stay out of this! You only ever served to pit Alecto further against me!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What are you saying!? I’ve only ever stuck around to make sure everyone
    escapes with their life. That includes nitwits like you!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lexy didn’t respond, too occupied with Alecto. The knight tried to puncture
    her in the back, bypassing her Aura. A foolish tactic. Lexy parried the
    attack with her wheel, then spun it around to whack
    <i>
        Lucifer.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Alecto! I am your Team Leader! Stop- <i>Argh!”</i> He soared through a
    stone dam, releasing a floodgate of rainwater down into the depth of Terra
    Insanire. And since he was now among the river, he <i>too</i> plunged in
    uncertainty.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “...None of this matters, anyway.” Alecto rested her hands on her knees,
    completely drained. “Beleth is dead. He must be. Lady Eleanor wouldn’t have
    let him survive.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Beleth is alive.” A deep voice swerved through the mountainous waves that
    had carried Lance’s backbone away. “Lucifer made sure of that. He stood in
the way of Eleanor, and gave him ample opportunity to scurry away.”    <i>Boreas</i> strutted out of the water, holding Lucifer up, one of the
    soldier’s arms wrapped around him.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Then I’m set to rendezvous with him.” Lexy stated. She hopped out of view,
    further into the chasm. “Don’t follow me.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Grr! Get back here!” Alecto ran after her. Perhaps she would’ve made good
    ground in a race. Perhaps not. No one will ever know thanks to Eleanor, who
    landed in front of her, and prevented a chase.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Enough. The Delphic escaped. We’ll rebound later, with a better plan.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No, we’ll rebound <i>now!</i> He couldn’t have gotten that far!” She tried
    to push past, but Eleanor crouched down and grabbed her by the arm. “Get
    out of my way!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “No. Your rage. If you let it consume everything, you can lose
        yourself. You’re too brazen, too quick to temper. Control your anger,
        or it will control you. That is not something to take lightly, Lady
        Alecto.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Let go! Do you want to kill Beleth, or not? I thought you were on my
    side-”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Listen to me!”</i>
    Eleanor shook her, more and more alarmed with Alecto’s brash decision
    making.
    <i>
        “When you donned that armor, whatever game you thought this was ended.
        You’re not <b>playing</b> warrior anymore. There are those battles
        where you move forward, and those where you retreat! It is no longer
        time to fight! We regroup, learn, and return twice as powerful! Many
        years ago, I stood at the <b>same</b> crossroads you find yourself at
        now, and my decision cost me my left eye. Don’t repeat my failures.”
    </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…” Alecto stood in silence, as if she vanished, leaving behind nothing but
    a hollow pyramid of metal plating. “We regroup. We learn. We return.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s right. Come. We must leave this place.” The tallest, and by far
    most experienced of anyone within the mountains watched Alecto pace back to
    the Meridian, disappointed. Lucifer joined her side.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“…Eleanor.”</i>
    He nodded, having the sense not to offer another handshake.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>

<p>
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    She left. The two leaders hiked in the opposite, satisfied that if
    anything, they were able to stop anyone from dying
    <i>
        again.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>

        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I used the last shred of the Beryl Rhinestone’s energy left on my
    equipment to reactive the door. It’s all gone. <i>Everything</i> is gone. I
    was hoping the stone would’ve been found by now. I brought a rocket
    propelled locker here, too, but Zara already used it to get back into
    Vale.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What!?” It was Lucifer’s turn to step out of line. “Why didn’t you have
    Selene leave? She needs it more than anyone!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “She was my first choice, but Zara insisted. She wouldn’t take no for an

<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “L-Lucifer?” Selene herself, with Merlin as backup, crept onto the scene.
    She was still somewhat timid concerning their dilemma. “It’s fine. I can
    handle myself. I don’t need to leave more so than anyone else.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>

<p>
    “I understand that. But this isn’t normal practice anymore. People can get

    Selene’s face dropped. She held Merlin in her arms before stomping away
    without bothering to say goodbye.

    “You should probably go after her.” Boreas said.

    </p>

<p>
    “…Negative. She’s right. She has Royal Necrocyst. <i>And</i> Merlin. Not to
    mention, Rade and Nadia have gone rogue this entire time. Likely, they’re
    protecting her. It falls to <b>me</b> to stop this madness, and the further
    Selene is from myself, the safer she is.” Lucifer sat down on a searing
    lakebed, still partially soaked from his adventures in the flood. “At the
    start of this semester, I watched her like a <i>hawk.</i> I still do, but
    at the beginning, <b>I</b> was all she had. Strange. Now she has friends
who see her as I do. Trusting them to put her above themselves is something    <i>I’m</i> still struggling to do. She isn’t. She’s too brave for her own
    good.”

    Night launched an invasion of the skies earlier than usual. The chirping
    birds settled into the hoots of owls. Critters of any kind burrowed
    underground, or hid behind rocks. They were replaced with the less amicable
    Grimm. Throughout this process, most chose to sleep, or play basic board
    games in the dirt. But for two, these were work hours.
    <i>
        <p>

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Hya! Hya! Hya!”</i>
    Alecto swung again and again, honing her form against Eleanor. The coach
    acted as an elusive target. Finally, Eleanor swooped back with another
    proverb.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re putting far too much power into your strikes. It only serves to
    tire you out, and open yourself up for attack afterward. If you’re going to
    cut your target in half, you don’t need to exert <i>every</i> ounce of
    strength. Especially not with a weapon as well made as this one. The sword
    is a <i>tool.</i> Let it do the work.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I understand.” Alecto lowered her mask and continued the joust, trying to
    apply the advice until Eleanor began outlining another point of
    improvement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You must control your breathing better. Exhale with every stab forward.
    It’ll increase the force output and help you conserve energy. If you can
    catch a rhythm with your breathing, we can begin incorporating Aura into
    your fighting style.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh! Can we focus on that? <i>I</i> want to learn how to teleport! Or leap
    really high! Or catch bullets!” Alecto sheathed her sword and bowed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Of course. Aura manipulation can let you do many things only previously
    achievable with a semblance. But be warned, Lady Alecto. This training will
    surpass anything you’ve experienced in the past.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I want to try.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Understood.” Eleanor slammed her hand into the nearby tree, knocking what
    small amounts of fruit it held into her shoulder piece, which acted as a
    bowl. <i>“This</i> is your dinner. It is all you will receive to eat
    tonight. If you can take it from me before I reach the river, it is yours.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…What’s the catch?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Smart. We’re going to switch helmets.” After looking around to make sure
    nobody was watching, Eleanor slipped hers forward.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What!? But I cannot part with-”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You can trust me. I understand what that inheritance is worth to you. Rest
    assured, it’ll meet no harm in my presence.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “O-Okay…” Once she did what was asked of her, she almost instantly undid
    the mistake. “W-Wait a minute! You can’t <i>breathe</i> in this thing! And
    I can only use one of my eyes!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “First step to integrating your breathing into Aura usage is to control it.
    One breath is all you have. If you remove that again, the test is over and
    you will receive nothing to eat. The moment the fruit touches water, you
    have lost. <i>Begin!”</i> Eleanor forced the helmet back on and took off.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto could barely keep up for the first sequence of twists and turns, and
    now Eleanor had taken the hunt to the trees. Indeed the river was far, but
    in this state time was running short.
    <i>
“This is insane! How am I supposed to catch up with someone like        <b>her</b> on <b>one</b> breath!?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Maybe there was a chance Alecto could outrun her on the ground, but if she
    had to follow the ascent, this challenge was hopeless. And already, her
lungs were burning.    <i>The moment the fruit touches water, you have lost. </i>The criteria was
    played on repeat within her mind. Then, suddenly, she realized it didn’t
    matter if she caught Eleanor. That was a red herring. In truth, making it
    to the river first was the key to success.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Swerving past trees and above rocks, the destination was far more easily
    reached than whatever obscure route Eleanor traversed. But not by much.
    Alecto was only a few seconds behind Eleanor, who stood high in a topiary
    tower. She threw the harvest down such that interception was impossible.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “This session is over. You can try again tomorrow- <i>huh?”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Every last drop of the river was swept into a typhoon, which traveled into
    the void of Alecto’s semblance. The black orb, which was no taller than
    Alecto’s palm, had the entire creek contained. Her meal landed on dry
    stone.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The neophyte removed the helmet, choking for air. “Ack! None of the fruit
    touched <i>water.”</i> Alecto laughed, helping herself to the buffet. “That
    was your stipulation, if you recall.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…You clever snake!” Eleanor dropped down and corrected both their wardrobe
    situations, chuckling. “Time and time again you surprise me.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Thank you, Lady Eleanor. But we should probably move, before I release the
    water.” She explained with her mouth full. “Mm! S-Sorry…”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t be. You earned it. You should rest, now. But first, there’s
    something I want to show you.” She led the way to a makeshift bed woven
    from the softest leaves. “It didn’t take me too long to make. It’s a nice
    past time.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I love it!” Alecto exhaled, appreciating some amount of cushion after
    spending many nights on the polar opposite.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I knew you would. Tomorrow, we’ll work on your semblance. There is so much
    potential. Goodnight, Lady Alecto.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You too, Lady Eleanor.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Anything that contributed towards the eradication of a Delphic was work
    worth doing, according to Eleanor. But that’s not why she was here to
    begin with. The Rhinestone and any object of similar prominence, due to
    their rarity, was worth foregoing a Delphic’s death. The choice was
    arduous, but clear.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Pssst! Whatcha problem!?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Troy!? What are you doing here?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I <i>live</i> here. At least, I have for the past week.” He followed her.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Week. Right.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So, when are we getting out of here? I know you’re just here to make sure
    I’m safe and sound. But now that you’ve seen to <i>that,</i> how about some
    lunch?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
Eleanor dismissed every nonsensical assertion of his.    <i>“What are you doing here, Troy?</i> Alecto and her crew’s been in and
    out of here <i>numerous</i> times. You could’ve walked out of here. And I
    assume hundreds of travelers have braved these roads. Why are you wasting
    your time in here, after all these years, waiting for me to <i>‘rescue’</i>
    you? I didn’t even know you were still alive… <i>How</i> are you alive?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, well, it’s simple. I eat apples. I exercise daily…” He began counting
    on his fingers. “I try to live a very carefree lifestyle. Stress is
    overrated. Bad for the heart, as they used to say!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’ve eaten apples, too. Am <i>I</i> immortal? <i>Yes.</i> But not because
    of that. Let me try this. Do you know who I am?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How could I forget you? You’re Eleanor, of Clotho’s Coven!” Troy complied.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “And when did we last see each other?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Um… I think we were fighting some bloke named <i>Abigor? No, no,</i>
    that’s not right. It was, <i>uh,</i> the <b>Wraith!</b> Yeah, that’s right!
    Some spindly little bastard with <i>claws.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “And when was <i>that?” </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Um. Is it summer, yet?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I think I’m starting to see the problem. You must’ve hit your head upon
    arrival. But that still doesn’t explain how you’ve managed to last this
    long.” Eleanor laughed off the weight of several boulders, clearing that
    area of suspicion and forming a new path.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You know, I’ve had quite the scuffles. I once killed <i>six</i> bandits,
    singlehanded, with one arm tied behind my back.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Is that supposed to impress me? I once killed three-<i>hundred</i> Grimm
    with one eye.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So what?” Troy somehow had an eye-patch, probably for sale, hidden among
    his supplies. “If I put this on, I can still take you down.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“No.”</i>
    Eleanor refuted both the basis and conclusion of his argument. “Not like
    that. Don’t you remember what a silver-eyed warrior can do?” She froze an
    incoming Creep in place, turning it to <i>stone.</i> “Or do I need to
    demonstrate my talents on <i>you</i> firsthand?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “…Hahaha! You haven’t the spine to hurt me, Eleanor. I know you don’t.
        Go ahead!”
    </i>
    Troy raised his arms, basking in the victory he already knew he’d obtained.
    Eleanor walked away, leaving him to congratulate himself
    <i>
        alone.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Eventually, the aimless trails carried Eleanor to a mostly unknown batch of
    soon to be Huntsmen and Huntresses, all sleeping. The union of Rade, Nadia,
    and Selene was unearthed. One of them was wrapped in Lucifer’s cape, the
    other slumbering in a nest of branches, and the last tied to a tree by his
    feet.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Is that? It can’t be!”</i>
    Eleanor had her sights set on Selene’s tiara. Even in pitch black, the gem
    it held throbbed with flamboyant light.
    <i>
        “What is it doing here?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
She came for the <i>Rhinestone,</i> but would gladly settle for    <i>this.</i> The rattling of chainmail was quenched, as now stealth was the
    deciding factor. She could never fight the three, nor did she have any
    desire to, but acquiring the <b>Black Dust</b> was worth the risk.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Almost, she stood above Selene. Looking forward, she had to peek at her
    feet to dodge Merlin. But when she stared forward again, Rade’s face was
    less than inches away. Previously strung up, he studied Eleanor closely.
    Reluctant to make a sound, and mortified more so than intimidated, she
    allowed him to make the first move.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Hehehehe!”</i>
    He struggled not to chuckle, then after signaling her to be quiet, he
    pointed <i>down.</i> His signature jack-in-the-box sprung open, where a
    stuffed version of himself resided.
    <i>
        “…Peek-a-boo.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He latched onto her neck and delivered a respectable hit with his own
    forehead, then initiated a horrid combo composed of pitchfork twirling.
    This commotion snapped everyone else awake, creating a mob that would
    certainly reinforce Rade.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If she so wished, Eleanor could’ve ended Rade and his aid in a matter of
    seconds. But she <i>didn’t</i> wish that. She still longed for the tiara,
    and her tunnel vision for it was evident. Not vexing to hit any of them
    back, she failed to repel the attacks of all but Selene. “Halt! You
    encroach in concerns not yet comprehended! Please, all I need is the
    Empress’s
    <i>
        Black Dust, and I can put an end to this!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well, all you had to do was ask nicely!” Rade belittled the appeal. “It’s
    a nice little smack of jewelry, but it isn’t yours! And if you can’t get
    your greedy little mittens it, never fear! Except
    <i>
        me!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Eleanor, after receiving a hardy amount of abuse from Nadia and Rade, used
    Tormentyst. Not to hurt anyone, but to flip around, and hurl herself
    towards Selene.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Got it!”</i>
    She plucked the headpiece away against the retorts of its owner, then leapt
    away. At least, that was the idea. But the skeletal grasp of Royal
    Necrocyst ripped her out of the sky by her cape, and started repeatedly
    slamming her against the floor.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“What!? A Necrocyst aligns against <b>me!?</b> At her command?”</i>
    Eleanor coughed out as she was flung around like an oversized doll.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yay! I got it back!” Selene balanced the tiara back on her head. It
    must’ve shook loose from Eleanor while she had been brutalized by Royal.
    And now, even with all this aura to spare, she was being juggled by Rade,
    Nadia, <i>and</i> Merlin.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    When she had been bludgeoned into a wall, to then be pulverized by Rade and
    his expertise in turning gardening tools into killing machines, she
    dropped her foil. Meaning to take full advantage of this, and throw Eleanor
    even further into a hole, Rade bypassed his own malnourishment and scooped
    it up without much difficulty. Tormentyst wouldn’t have done anything to
    Eleanor even if she hadn’t evaded every swing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Against all odds, Eleanor’s tenacity shone through. She intercepted the
    sword then punted it away mid-vault. She not only executed this maneuver
    with perfect aim, but she did so with speed too extreme for anyone to
    react. <i>“By the gods, don’t miss. I pray, Lady Clotho, don’t miss…” </i>
    Tormentyst brushed past Selene’s hair without slicing any stands, caught
    her chaplet, and somehow landed back in her hands.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No! W-Wait! Don’t go!” Selene begged, putting Royal back in its cage.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Amazingly, without revoking the slightest unit of Aura from anyone, Eleanor
had won. “You have my undying solidarity, for I understand how much    <i>this</i> means to you. But I cannot allow an object that harbors such evil to occupy this world. I’m sorry.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Wait! I need that!”</i>
    Eleanor disobeyed, and earnestly fell off the mountainside. Tears began to
    bloom in her eyes. “…I’ve had that tiara for as long as I can remember.
    Lucifer’s going to <i>kill</i> me when he finds out about this!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No, he won’t!” Nadia kneeled down to comfort her. “Don’t cry! Lucifer
    would <b>never</b> hurt you. None of us would. We just need to get it back.
    Think about this. Remember <i>Grover,</i> from initiation?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Mhm.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>

    “It tried to destroy your tiara. It tried to step on it, remember? But it
    can’t be destroyed by normal means. And that girl, whoever she was, isn’t

    optimistic smile. But deep inside, she couldn’t shake the feeling that not

    Rhinestone wasn’t any closer. In truth, she was <i>right.</i>
