<div class=WordSection1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center'><i><span style='color:#806000'>Nobody’s Arrival and
the Fall of Lance</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ha! As if I
could lose to a grimm! Shut it Beleth, actions speak louder than words!” Lexy
dragged her fist across the center table, swiping the alarm clock and plant
onto the floor to make way for an arm wrestling match. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Music
speaks louder than either! Hit me with your best shot, I dare you!” He laughed,
entertaining the contest. They held hands and pulled, each holding the other behind
their back. Gritting their teeth and leaning in with carnivorous grins, Beleth
and Lexy were a far cry from the peaceful morning and chirping from outside the
dorm rooms. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>After many
seconds, the table gave out as the culmination of their rivalry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Ouch.</i>
We really need a better table for this. Guess I’m paying for that one,
considering I <i>won.”</i> He boasted. He was already bracing himself against a
speeding pillow from Lexy’s bed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“How did <i>you</i>
win? You let go first!” Lexy stomped her feet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“When my hand
leaves <i>your</i> hand, we <i>both</i> let go. How could either of us <i>‘let
go first?’</i> And what’s the alternative? Continuing the game without a <i>table</i>
you dunce?” Beleth made a movement with his hand to suggest Lexy was crazy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Maybe we
should ditch the whole arm-wrestling thing.” She said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Excuses to
give up.” He rolled his eyes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You’re in
denial.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I deny that
fact!” He argued. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Keep it up,
and I’ll whack you upside the head with that violin.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You
wouldn’t dare touch my violin! You love the sound too much.” Beleth balanced
the instrument on his shoulder, gesturing as his bow was missing. Another
fluffy projectile was launched. “If you wanted a pillow fight, you could ask.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Imagine <i>team</i>
pillow fights. Who would you want on your side, Zara or Rade?” She sat down. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I think the
last thing either of us needs is a wild card. Rade’s quick sure, but his jerky
movements just make me really uncomfortable.” He giggled. “Can you imagine
moving like that? He looks like a robot half the time.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Does that
make him human the other half? What like a <i>cyborg?</i> Don’t be ridiculous.”
Lexy shook her head at the idea, opening up the window to wake their top
choice. “Zara, get up! It’s almost time for class!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Mhm.
Wh-what time is it?” She mumbled, one of her arms hanging off the bed towards
the vacant scenery.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It’s about
five to nine.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“What?</i>
Move!” She sprung out of bed through the cabin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Where’s the
fire?” Beleth blocked the exit. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Here!” Zara
held up a flaming hook to his face, scaring him out of the way. “Class is like
four minutes away! You guys wanna be late again, stay here! But if you’re
smart, you’ll come with me! And that includes Rade. Where is he, anyway?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Probably at
class.” Beleth shrugged, following her eyes to the vacant sleeping bag strapped
to the ceiling fan.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Then get
going!” She bolted through the door. Her two teammates laughed after her. Down
the elevator, through the halls, and out the building brought them halfway
there. And they only lost <i>two</i> minutes. It seemed all their concern was
for not, as another two had them stationed in a class that had no signs of
starting soon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Finally
reading up on those textbooks, huh?” Beleth nudged Rade in the shoulder. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Only the
most important one, the <i>Fear Index!</i> And that reminds me, Beleth. Most
people fear grimm, but I doubt you fear <i>yourself!</i> I mean, you may, but
that’s strangely uncommon. So the question must be asked, what <i>do</i> you
fear?” Even though Rade had accumulated a wealth of knowledge on this subject, all
solidified in his book, some peers slipped through the cracks. Such was the
case with his own team. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You should
really find better mind games than just rambling and hoping we let our guard
down.” Beleth took a seat with the rest of Team Blazer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I save <i>those</i>
ploys for when it truly matters! Trust me, if I <i>really</i> needed your
fears, it’d already be done. Same goes for our pals over on Lance!” He
admitted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Give me a
break. Don’t forget, you were more than willing to <i>fight</i> Lucifer over
the issue, and you’re telling me you could have found out what he was scared of
right then and there if you wanted to?” Zara beamed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Please.
Little more than friendly competition, data on his fighting stance more so than
his nightmares, plus since that time I’ve deduced his secrets! As though I need
anybody to <i>tell</i> me.” Rade’s rant was merely friendly banter, as his
voice indicated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Okay, what
is it then?” Lexy interjected. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“The best
magicians never give away their tricks!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“C’mon, this
is Team Blazer, baby! That’s <i>Beleth, Lexy, Zara,</i> and you- <i>Rade!</i>
Your secret’s safe with us!”  Their team leader announced. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Frankly I
think I’d rather punch myself in the face than trust you with a secret.” Lexy,
despite her threat, hit <i>him</i> in the arm. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You’d mess
up your hair just for me?” He teased, prepping a lunge as he was certain she’d
aggress. He was right. He almost tripped over both Zara and Rade just to graze
by Lexy’s wrath. Both zoomed into their seats once a clue of Stam’s return came
forth, and it was only then that they noticed somebody sitting next to him, sleeping.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Class is
now in session! Welcome everyone, thank you for coming! As you’re all aware, we’ve
started late as I figured today, to celebrate the arrival of our new faculty,
we’d have a bit of fun. Allow me to introduce to you the newest staff member of
Beacon Academy: <i>Professor Audrey Penelope!”</i> Stam gave her a firm pat on
the back, snapping her out of her slumber. It was clear she was snoozing away
up until that point, leaning her head on her arm. The promise of a huntress
alone brought forth applause. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It’s an
honor to meet you all. I look forward to getting to know each of you one by one.”
Audrey didn’t have the energy to yell nor get up, even after some sips of
coffee. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You see,
Miss Penelope, or rather <i>Professor Penelope,</i> is clearly a new teacher
here at Beacon. Noting how she’s the slightest bit inexperienced, and there’s
no open classrooms at this time, she’ll be accompanying <i>us</i> until we can
get her better situated. Right!” Stam set his hand on her shoulder again,
seizing her from her dreams a second time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Th-that’s
right! You guys are in the middle of the defensive unit, if I’m not mistaken.”
She finally stood up, nodding when the class confirmed her hunches. “Perfect.
Surely by now, each of you understand the value of… how do I say this? <i>Not
getting hit?</i> Point is, we’re putting a twist on the typical exercise by
partaking in <i>team duels.” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The classroom’s
inhabitants rumbled, excited at the idea. Professor Stam took over for a
longwinded explanation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“The way
this works is, team leaders will fight each other. First person to take damage
loses, no surprise there! Once a victor is determined, they will fight the next
member of the beaten team! First team to lose all its members will lose, simply
put. First teams to fight: Lance and Blazer!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Got it.
So If I lose, Alecto will fight the leader I failed to beat. If she wins, she
fights the next in Team Blazer. But then, if we somehow lose three times, <b>Selene</b>
will have to fight.”</i> Lucifer gave himself a silent briefing. “And that’s
not an option <i>yet.”</i> The team chiefs joined each other on the stage where
Penelope was waiting</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                                                                                                                                                              </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What’s your
name?” She shook the soldier’s hand, then the violinist’s.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Lucifer.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Beleth, great
to meet you!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You too.
Stam, do I just tell them to fight?” She inquired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yes!
They’ll do the rest.” Stam had all the answers. With Penelope’s signal, action
sprung out from both sides. Without any clue of Beleth’s attitude in combat nor
in general despite knowing Rade and Zara, Lucifer was in for a shock. Anybody
in this position would be perplexed to see him raise a violin to begin the
fight. He was scarily affective at unnerving a target with the supposed battle
stance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Lucifer
paused before running in to end the fight with hopefully a simple strike.
Beleth planned everything, capitalizing on the unfamiliarity with a standard
but unorthodox method of fighting. He raked his bow across the strings, using his
<i>semblance</i> to transmute music into energy-bolts. A powerful rift was
ripped into reality out of thin air, blasting Lucifer onto his back. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“W-What!? <i>Argh!”</i>
He slammed his clenched hand onto the ground. Had this been a normal fight,
that one ruse alone wouldn’t have been enough to defeat Lucifer, but it
wouldn’t work a second time. Alecto had watched like a hawk, and her
competitive spirit mixed with a lust for victory would make her hard to hit. At
least, that was the idea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>On
Penelope’s mark, Alecto flipped around the musical onslaught to meet Beleth
head on. Her cape may have been caught a few times, but her aura was all that
mattered. The same applied to Beleth, although the admittedly luxurious sound
of his violin had vanished along with the possibility of long ranged combat, he
still had the bow. Long, sturdy, and with a bladed edge made for this sort of
bout, he decided to show off impressive swordplay. But Alecto still had him
beat. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>His parries
were good at blocking her sword, but he became too eager with <i>just</i> that
strategy. Alecto finally found an opening once he had overextended, sending him
into the air with cape whip. Surely the fall would take a bit of his aura, she
rationalized, pausing for a breather. She had completely overlooked the
advantages of a projectile-based weapon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Prior to
hitting the floor, Beleth played a simple stroke and blindsided Alecto. They’d
lost the smallest bit of aura within one second of each other, but that tiny
window was enough to determine that Beleth won. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ah- fine.
You win.” Alecto got up and shook his hand. “That was clever, I’ll admit, but
it <i>won’t</i> happen again.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“No!</i> Uh,
Nadia! I need a favor!” Lucifer turned to his last gambit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Of course.
What is it?” She flexed her needles, preparing herself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Selene
can’t go up there, her Semblance isn’t developed enough yet! She won’t stand a
chance. I need you to beat Team Blazer and spare her a hopeless fight.” He
spoke with tamed respect, but not enough to prevent Selene’s knowledge of his
request. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It’s
alright, really. I can at least <i>try</i> dodging.” The princess didn’t want
to burden anyone, but her worries were audible through her shivering voice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“No. <i>It’s
going to be alright.</i> I’ll try taking them on. It can’t be that hard to get
one hit off for a nimble assassin like me, wouldn’t you say?” Nadia gave a
classic smile and headed to the arena. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Thank you.”
Lucifer couldn’t let her favor go unpaid, as long as she succeeded. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Don’t
mention it.” Nadia passed Alecto to fight this mysterious lyrical musician. Considering
his tattered blindfold, it should be even easier to sneak up on him than usual.
Penelope- after getting their names, declared the fight had begun, and Nadia
dissipated from existence before the Beleth could even get situated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What the!?”
He lowered his violin in pure bewilderment. Much like the strategy he used on
Lucifer, the unknown semblance ended the duel in seconds. Nadia was already
behind him, and had jammed one of her toxins into his back. “Ouch!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Nadia
wins!” Stam couldn’t help but laugh. Whenever the fight wasn’t a tremendous
joust eating up an extensive amount of time, it was over in less than five
seconds.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>After two victories,
Beleth likely couldn’t have given much more anyway. Lexy, by contrast, was
brimming with energy, just waiting to embolden their lead. Not to mention she
just seen the winning tactic twice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Name’s
Lexy.” She held a peace sign forward. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Nadia. Love
the look.” Nadia wasn’t lying. Indeed the two were nearly apposite in
appearance, they were each great in their own right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You too! I
don’t usually like blue, but it looks great on you-“ </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Enough
chit-chat! Fight!” Another announcement from Stam of the battle’s beginning,
and they were off. Nadia learned from Lucifer’s mistakes, studying Lexy rather
than charging in. The Flame Bearer fought with a <i>wheel,</i> a mechanical
apparatus enveloped in fire. Twirling it around from a chain was a neat
distraction, not that it gave much data. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Without
warning, the contraption was swung around, creating a real problem as the
lingering inferno made the danger zone much bigger than it seemed. Avoiding the
wheel altogether was the best option. Using her semblance only to keep Lexy
guessing rather than a crutch kept her in the challenge up until she was within
stabbing distance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Haha!
Gotcha!” Lexy somersaulted away with ease. Nadia quickly deduced that breaking
distance wasn’t the way to go as long as Lexy persisted such mobility. If only
there was some way to anchor her down…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Nadia
figured it out. Turning invisible and grabbing the chain holding the hot gear
caused it to swivel around, back into its owner. Lexy, as long as her chain was
being held, could not escape. Losing more aura than anyone with a single clash,
she was bested disregarding the fact she had plenty more to give. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oof! Good
fight! I can’t wait for a <i>real</i> one sometime.” Lexy got to her feet. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hey, rules
are rules. Frankly with a strategy like that, I’d be <i>scared</i> to spar with
you.” Nadia sent her back with a compliment to compromise. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Man! She’s
good.” Lexy huffed in her seat, knowing she was just giving Beleth more
material. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Too good.
If only you had some sort of music-oriented semblance to-“ He started, but
couldn’t finish. Lexy tackled him to the ground out of view under the desk.
Zara had to leave for her turn, hoping draw the attention off them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Go get ‘em!
But don’t get ‘em too hard, I want a shot at this too!” Rade slapped his desk
over and over to emphasize his encouragement. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Finally, a
familiar face.” Nadia gasped. The last two rounds had done a number on her.
Winning another two seemed like an impossibility. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yeah, no
kidding. Have you ever met Beleth or Lexy?” Zara looked back at the unusual
combatants. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“No. Quite
the rude awakening.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Great work
everyone! We’re all squared up now, two of you remain on either team! As in the
field, there are times you’ll have not a moment to recover! Fight!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>If it was an
option, Nadia would throw the towel in. A glance at Lucifer reminded her why
she was doing this rather than passing the torch onto Selene. <i>I-I can’t let
him down!</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Zara danced
around with her heated hooks whirling in all directions, requiring strenuous
evasion techniques. But this engagement would not last as long as the others.
Nadia formulated a plan that would be her downfall. She grabbed ahold of both
the hooks then tried pulling Zara in- a modification of her approach with Lexy.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Your
students are really good.” Penelope analyzed every match along with Stam. “When
I was in Beacon, fighting ability was all that anyone cared about. I like how <i>cunning</i>
the fighters are these days.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yes,
indeed. It’s these sorts of alternate scenarios that force my students to think
on their feet. Wit alone can take you far, but only if paired with their
strengths. It’s the hands off approach that worked for me, and it’ll work for
them. I guarantee it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“That’s
probably why I was so sleepy in class. My teachers gave me writing assignments
and called it a day. I’m afraid semblance training was the only experience <i>I</i>
had. Besides, of course… N-Never mind.” She yawned several times in her
elaboration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What do you
think of this gambit here? Miss Haken seems to be in great trouble.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Zara has
this one under control. Her confidence tells me she must have something up her
sleeve much like those hooks. Pulling her in while disabling her weapons is
foolproof, but only to <i>fools.”</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Very good,
Professor Penelope. I’m impressed.” Stam watched the prediction come true. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Her
knowledge of Zara only ran so deep, and in the chaos she overlooked a pivotal
ability possessed by the faunus. The hooks in her hands were set aflame even at
a great distance from their master, and nothing could be done to prevent the
burning. She lost.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“No!” Nadia
fell to her knees, confirming her failure by looking up at the live scoreboard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Good work,
Miss Haken. Miss Virtus, please come up! I say it’s about time we saw something
from you!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“What did
you do</i>?!” Lucifer berated his teammate upon her return, making sure to keep
an indoor voice but maximize how evident his frustration was. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I tried, I
swear! It was too much for me.” She couldn’t face him head on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It’s not a
big deal, guys!” Selene tried her best to diffuse the situation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You had to
do <i>one</i> thing!” He wasn’t having it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I had to do
<i>four</i> things! Neither you, nor <i>you</i> could beat <b>one</b>
opponent!” She pointed first at her aggressor, then Alecto. “I’m sorry I
couldn’t cover for <i>all</i> your mistakes.”<i> </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ahem!” Stam
had somehow marched to their table without making a sound. “There seems to be
some sort of issue here. Very well. Just this once, I’ll let Miss Virtus opt
out. In her place, Mister… err, <i>Merlin</i> can fight. I’d like to see what
he can do up close, anyway.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Thank the
gods. You have my gratitude, Professor.” Lucifer couldn’t help an exhale of
relief. Nadia laid her head in her arms, concealing her face. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“But that quarrel
will have to wait! Class should be just about over now. Time flew quickly! Have
a great rest of your day everyone, and remember, I’m always right here if you
need me!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Team Lance
left in unison, waiting until they were outside to continue their disrupting
debate. Walking at a brisk pace, they made it to the entrance of their dorm
room before Nadia felt her instinctive guilt eating away at her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Lucifer.
I’m sorry, I really tried to win all those fights for you! I promise.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I <i>wish</i>
I had a semblance like yours. You could have done the cloak-and-dagger every
single time without error! It’s all I ask.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You don’t
understand! You’re asking me for favors all the time! Like with Selene and her
semblance! I’d have helped whenever possible, I just couldn’t at that moment!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Guys, we
should really do this somewhere else.” Selene failed to reach her pals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You were
enjoying yourself at <i>Augustus Correctional,</i> pinning us as a third
wheel!” Lucifer shouted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“That’s not
true! Ella needed my help, she needs to figure out who she <i>is!”</i> Nadia
was tired of his constant intrusions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Ella</i>
this, <i>Ella</i> that! It’s all I ever hear from you anymore! The only thing
worse is your non-stop defense of those freaks in the White Fang! What’s so
important about <i>either</i> of them?!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Lucifer,
let it go! We can talk about this later.” Alecto slipped in-between them. He
shoved her out of the way. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“You’ve
tested my patience for the last time! I am your <b>Team Leader,</b> and you <b>will</b>
follow my command! The White Fang is a band of feral beasts, heartless! As is <b>anyone</b>
who sympathizes with them!” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“How dare you!”
Nadia swung her fist forward, aiming for his chest. He was too fast, snatching
her hand out of the air and throwing his teammate to the ground with one pull.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Go run
off with your <b>real</b> friends at Augustus Correctional Facility.”</i> His
words had an eerily cold ring to it. She looked him in the eyes, with tears in
her own. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                                                                           </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“I-I hate
you! I’m leaving to Mistral! You’re never going to see me again!”</i> Nadia
broke down, scrambling to her feet and running away. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Nadia,
wait! Stop!” Selene reached forward. It was impossible for her to gain any
ground in a race of these proportions, and she knew it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Lucifer!”</i>
Alecto seethed. She didn’t have time to reprimand him if she wanted to catch up
with the huntress disciple. Nadia navigated her way to the gates of Beacon
Academy without looking back. Any pursuers were too distant to catch up. It
wasn’t until she stopped at the main avenue to wipe her eyes that the rattling
armor gave away Alecto’s presence, doing the job long before her words did. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Wait,
Nadia! You <i>can’t</i> go! You’re coming back, <i>right!?”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><br>
<i>“Never.” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Don’t do
this! I’ll make Lucifer apologize, we can go meet Ella <i>together!</i> We can
still fix this, your friends need you!” Alecto begged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“I don’t
have any friends.”</i> Nadia sprinted away once again. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Don’t
say that! I… I’m one of them…”</i> She whispered that last part to herself,
comprehending the deadest determination of Nadia. Alecto had no choice but to
watch her hooded ex-teammate leave Beacon Academy, and Team Lance altogether. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Seeing as
how she’d made the trip to and from Vale’s prison so many times, she could make
it there faster than anyone else save for Augustus himself. And now taking into
account her predicament, this was the fastest she’d ever travelled this path.
After that, the classic bridge was all that stood in her way. It didn’t stop
her. She’d become a master of roaming the complex’s corridors. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Augustus.

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Welcome

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“N-Nothing.
How are you doing?” She questioned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Good, good.
But we I’ve got bad news. We’ve still found nothing on Ella.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yes?” The
Fleeting Ghost herself entered the room at the mention of her name. Nadia
sighed, having just learned the last thing she wanted to hear. With no
explanation she was met with a snug hug. “N-Nadia!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Great to

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“As I was
saying, I’ve personally scoured the records. There’s nothing on her, in Vale at
least. But given her… digital complexion, I think it would be a good idea to
send her to <i>Atlas.</i> It’s likely she has some sort of connection to the
kingdom, and that’s not even acknowledging the fact we could abuse their
database and tech.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Atlas? That

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Can’t say
for sure. That’s not the worst of it though. Grimm attacks in Forever Fall have
reached a fever pitch, and not even the most secluded train tracks can escape
them altogether.” Augustus summoned a holographic map and highlighted the best
route. “We need somebody disposable to take her. Not only is my first option
better off dead, he’s more than capable. Neither of you are going to like this,
but I’ve already made my mind. Don’t worry, I am in <i>complete control.” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“W-Who is

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“He’s locked

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“No. We’re
not doing this.” Nadia already suspected his first choice. Her big mistake was
entertaining him by doing as he said, following behind. About ten dungeon doors
later, and all three were locked in a padded cell alongside the maniac himself.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Just
decided to drop in, eh? I don’t blame you, I’d want in on this hotel room,
too!” Dimitri grinned. He was sitting in the chair with both feet balanced on
the table. A thick chain was preventing his escape, attached to his folded
arms. “Nadia! How long as it been, my pretty?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Silence.”
Augustus grabbed the bold links to reel him in. “You’re in luck, outside

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Greetings,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Again?
Forget it, the point is, she’s going to Atlas through a train. It’s overrun

informed the criminal. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Really?

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“No!” Nadia
had counted on Dimitri to refuse. “Why can’t Ella just take a bullhead? <i>I</i>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Crossing a

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Mister <i>Gimp?</i>
At least I’ve got two legs, sonny!” Dimitri didn’t go any further with the

tortured. “How kind of you to trust so innocent a soul as me, can’t say I would
do the same!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Right you

exit. “With this, I’ll have your exact location at <b>all</b> times. If you go
dark on me, I <i>will</i> find you, and we’ll <i>both</i> be sorry. I’d talk to
you about how any attempts to remove it will result in your very timely demise,
but you <i>won’t</i> be taking it off. I’ll have personnel waiting for you in
Atlas.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>To make his

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Indestructible

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“But of
course. How else will you defend Ella? Anything happens to <i>her,</i> I’ll

led his three companions to a vault on the west end of his penitentiary. “The <i>Evidence
Locker.</i> Every little piece of scum has their goodies stored here. Pretty
much everything in this place gathers dust until it falls apart. I’d keep <i>you</i>
here to achieve the same effect if you weren’t so valuable.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Real
flattering, as if I like the situation. Aha, perfect! That’s <i>so</i> much
better!” Dimitri stashed his crowbar in his pants, gathered up his watch and
two necklaces, then wrapped his camera around his neck. Last was the iconic
boater hat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Is that

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Just
remember, if my patience is tested in any way, I’ll know our trust is

you myself-“ </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Tell the Administrator
I’m sure he’s looking very <i>cute</i> today.” Dimitri slammed the door of the
freight cart with Ella behind him. Augustus had nothing to say as his point was
already made several times and a few bangs on the locomotive would get Dimitri
out of here. It was about time. With that act, Dimitri and Ella left Vale.
Nadia turned to do the same. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Where are

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’m leaving

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What? After

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I… Guess
we’re both disappointed then.” She made her way east, to the welcoming arms of
Mistral whence she came. Nadia had already bid goodbye to one batch of
companions that day, now she was forced to do the same with another. Augustus
had nothing worth saying to halt her jog across the bridge other than a soft
omen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Goodbye.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Dimitri and
Ella blitzed through the Forever Fall forest in the wake of a dying sun. No
grimm had interrupted yet, fortunately for Ella. Dimitri cared not. A little
action probably would have done him well after such a long time in confinement.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ever been
to Atlas?” He asked. Ella gulped and shook her head. The prospect of spending
an afternoon with what she’d been told was a borderline psychopath wasn’t very
appealing. “Well when this caboose lands, I’ll show you around. It’s a bit cold,
but you won’t need any bug-spray. If we can score a villa in the mountains, the
worst I’ll bet on is a <i>creep.</i> Mere fodder, I tell you!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…Kind of.”
She had to admit while his voice and visage worked against him, Dimitri was <i>somewhat</i>
dressed like a normal person. She couldn’t really complain though, the way <i>she</i>
presented herself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What can I

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ah, damn.”
He tried to rip the machine off his arm to no avail. Banging it against the
control panel couldn’t work either. Ella gasped, focusing on the track. Sitting
in the main cart seemed the most sensible thing to do. Each segment of the
train was compact but thoroughly attached by several plated chains. “How in the
lord am I supposed to get rid of this thing?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I don’t
think you’re supposed to. Ah! W-What was that?” Something landed on the last of
many wagons, but the shockwaves could still be felt from the front. As if the
overhead screech of a griffon wasn’t enough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Wait here.
I’ll take care of everything this evening.” Dimitri sealed off the main engine
and pranced down every car to witness the intruder. He beheld a haunting
specimen with a cloud of dreary anxiety complimenting his very presence. The
figure was standing at the edge of the speeding monorail, oblivious to Dimitri.
His coat flapped in the wind whilst the stranger eyed the landscape. “Who are
you?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><b><i>“Nobody

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Alright, <i>Nobody.</i>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“These
shipments tend to hold dust, not that I care for that, but there’s nothing on
this one. Of all the trains I’ve raided, why was <i>this</i> one guarded? The
humans didn’t send you as an ambassador, did they?” Nobody rested his hand on the
hilt of his blade, approaching. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Humans?

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Ohhh,</i>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Well, if

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Me? I’m

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“How so?”

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“A mystery

ground first, always.’</i> he used to say. Well that’s exactly what I’m doing.
Not a very common strategy, but it’s one I’ve always lived by. It’s an honor
really, to be in my thoughts while using this blade.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I get the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“If that’s

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                                                                                                                                                                          </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I wouldn’t
waste this weapon on so trivial a matter, but it’s clear you hold no reservations.”
Nobody tossed the brand to Dimitri, allowing him to do the job himself. To his
amazement, unsheathing it revealed a fine blade with red etches in it. The
carrier itself acted as a stabbing tool. Even more impressive, it cut through
the tracking appliance on Dimitri’s arm like partially melted butter. The
mechanism dipped below, now out of sight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Ohhhhh,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“One of a

an even more stretched smile, both the sword and sheath were wrenched away from
Dimitri’s hands into his own through some seemingly foreign force. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Saw that

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Please. <b>Shut

keeping him high above the molting trees, basking in the horizon’s illuminator.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“And I
you, Nobody.”</i> Dimitri sat on the brink alongside him, savoring the shaky
alliance. They were both memorized by the sunset, possibly contemplating all
the ways the other might betray each other at that very moment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You and I
have made a deal now. I’ll keep watch of this route for your return, and when
you do, I will be there. You try me, and I’ll hunt you down in the snow if
that’s what it takes.” Without waiting, Nobody slowly fed his sword into its
holster. The admirable but increasingly loud sound bounced around the Forever
Fall Forest, and within three seconds a griffon’s roar joined them. That expert
call now done, Nobody leapt off the train onto the swooping grimm, tearing
through the air until he faded into the clouds. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Fantastic.”
Dimitri enjoyed the breeze before returned to the front chambers. Opening the
door startled an already uneasy Ella. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You’re

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Simply a
false alarm! Just a lost beowolf stupid enough to wander off the beaten path.
Something tells me that’s the only grimm setback we should be expecting. Nothing
but clear skies and fruitful rest lie ahead!” Dimitri leaned back in one of the
two seats, crossing his arms and getting comfy for the remainder of the rumbly
ride. But back in Vale, the more virtuous defenders had their hands full with
semblance training and damage control in Nadia’s wake. It was impossible to
tell which one was more arduous. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Selene’s

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ugh. It’s

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I actually

have a <i>chance.”</i> Alecto tried to describe the intricacies of semblances
as best she could. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I could
try, but I usually save it for the <i>real</i> threats. It’s a little intense.
But <i>maybe</i> I could try pulling back and… Here, have a look.” Alecto
switched arms to the normally absent golden broadsword. The last time it had
been utilized, she was taking down the Grover in the depths of the Emerald
Forest. So much had changed in that time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Aiming her
free arm forward and curling her barbed fingers, mixed with extreme
concentration, forced the nearby chair to warp. It was surrounded in a colorless
haze, which then congregated to form a liquid black sphere. Alecto put her hand
on her waist, admiring the work. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“So what is

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It locks
objects, or people, into <i>darkness</i> for a moment. Think if it like a stun,
that amplifies damage. This is just a small demonstration.” Alecto clarified.
To finish the show, she slashed the floating void with her sword. No apparent
effect, until a couple seconds later the ball shattered, and out bounced two
halves of a wooden chair. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Woah!

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Are we at
that point where we’re <i>naming</i> our semblances? Usually people just say
something generic like <i>‘strength.’</i> I’ve had a few <i>ideas</i> for a
name, as part of that fun little exercise Stam gave us. Like, <i>‘Keraseer
Justice’</i> or something similar. But enough about me. What’s your semblance
called, Lucifer? Come to think of it… what is your semblance, <i>period?”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I wouldn’t
say it’s a secret, but I’ll wait to reveal it until you’ve seen it firsthand. Scratch
that, because In fact, you already have. You just don’t know it.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Really? Is
it the ability to push my buttons?” Alecto mocked him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I wonder
what Nadia’s is called. Maybe we can ask her when she comes back.” Selene
sighed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“She’ll be
fine.” Lucifer turned, a hint of insecurity in his voice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“She said
she’d never be back, Lucifer. Could you at least <i>act</i> a little more
concerned, please, just to humor us?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I <i>am</i>
concerned. I just think she’ll come back. We can discuss things when she does.”
Lucifer left the combat halls, not in the mood to talk about it. Selene and
Alecto looked at each other as the doors closed behind him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I hope he’s
right. Anyway, back to semblance training. Again.” Alecto commanded. Selene
obeyed, raising her arms and concentrating to conjure up another purple pool.
Her semblance had not yet evolved past this primitive stage, this feat alone
impressing the overseer. There was far more work left to do, if Selene’s
recollection of her powers in the past were anything to go off of. </p>
