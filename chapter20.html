    The <i>beeping</i> was both hated and loved. Even if it pestered, its
    consistency was an indicator of Selene’s recovering livelihood. Within this
stale box she slumbered in bed, Lucifer never leaving. Never    <i>sleeping.</i> He waited alongside Selene, being the only one who never
    left as the rest from Beacon came and went to check on her periodically.
    Augustus Correctional had many visitors.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    When Alecto slipped inside for the first time, he didn’t know what to say.
    He suspected she was occupied all night with rescuing the rest, including
    Boreas. That required forcibly pulling knowledge of the Bone Graveyard from
    Zara prior to several secretive attempts at breaching Servus Portum.
    Lucifer wished to confirm this for himself.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Why hadn’t you come sooner?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-I had to save the others. And… I was scared. I <i>am</i> scared...” He
    looked down, the machine’s chirps breaking the silence. He couldn’t miss
    stray teardrops settling on the floor, Alecto dealing with the situation in
    her own right. “I didn’t mean to hurt her, Lucifer… I am <b>so</b> sorry.
    <i>
        This is all my fault. I don’t <b>care</b> what happens to me!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    She fell to his feet, hoping for some form of reconciliation. He had
    nothing to offer in response, true apprehension stirring inside while she
    pled. “I never wanted <i>any</i> of this! I should’ve listened to you from
    the beginning. You were right. <b>She</b> was right! Can either of you ever
    accept my apology?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “She will.” Lucifer lifted both her hands. “I know she would <i>never</i>
    abandon you. And I… I must trust her decision. Things will be different. This, I
    know to be true. Your regret is proof enough of
    <i>
        that.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t deserve her forgiveness, though. I’ve brought so much pain to so
    many.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That… That doesn’t matter, now. None of us benefit from that line of
    thinking. What’s done is done. I know we can fix this going forward. We
    must be <b>stronger.</b> And I <i>know</i> you will be better.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Thank you.” Alecto sat up and wrapped both her arms around him. “I    <i>will</i> be better.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Once Alecto retreated, Lucifer looked towards the corner of the room.
    <i>
        “…It’s alright. You can come out, now.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nadia blushed, her concentration faltering. Another time, she would ask
when and how he knew she was there. “I-I’m pretty bad at this whole    <i>‘talk’</i> stuff, so I thought maybe I would just hang back and let
    whatever plan Lady Hestia had for me take effect. I’ll be sure to thank her
    later.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer decided one leap of faith wouldn’t be <i>too</i> much. “Be sure to
    put in a word for me, too.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “All you ever had to do was ask.” She held them both close. “What about
    Selene? Is she getting better? It’s going to be alright, <i>right?”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “She’s fine. Her waist may trouble her for a couple weeks, but that’ll be
    the extent of her wounds. She’s <i>tough.</i> I’m betting she’ll smile the
    whole time as to not worry us.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ha. She always <i>was</i> that sort of friend. Will she wake, soon?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t know.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Selene opened her eyes, gleaming with happiness.
    <i>
        “I think she will.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Selene…” Lucifer turned and approached her bedside table where Alecto’s
    helmet housed Merlin, who hopped up at her voice and cuddled with her.
    “You’re okay? You’re okay.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Of course I’m okay, silly! No way a <i>sword’s</i> gonna stop <b>me!”</b>
    Selene flexed, forgetting her injuries. A wince came at the sudden
    movement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t move too much, alright? How are you feeling? Any pain?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Just an ache, is all. H-How long has it been? I don’t remember much of
    what happened near the end, haha.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto clenched her hand, kneeling. “We’re out of Terra Insanire. Y-You
    were hit with… <i>my sword.”</i> She shuddered. “I-I wasn’t aiming for you!
    I’m sorry. How can I make it up to you?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s fine. Just waking up to you three is enough. What about everyone
    else? Did they make it out okay?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Almost</i>
    everyone…” She bowed her head. Selene’s heart dropped.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Boreas didn’t make it.” Lucifer leaned on one arm. “He sacrificed himself
    to save Zara.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “H-He’s not dead, is he?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b>“No.</b>
    He’s just trapped in Terra Insanire. And without the Beryl Rhinestone,
    there’s only one way inside. <i>Servus Portum.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “W-Well… We’ll get him back, soon! We can find Nomad in Summit’s Blight and
    get it back from him! Or, we can arrange entry into-”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No.” Alecto halted anymore optimism. “It’s pointless. Even <i>Boreas</i>
    knew he wouldn’t be escaping anytime soon. He assured me he’d be fine.
    Right now, the most important thing is that <i>you</i> heal.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’ll take some time.” Lucifer added. “It may be awhile before you’re in optimal condition, but you should be back on your feet
    by morning.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What day <i>is</i> tomorrow? How long have I been out?” Selene squinted at
    a calendar pinned to the wall. “W-Wait a second! The <i>dance</i> is
    tomorrow! We can’t miss it!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “And we <i>won’t.</i> But <b>you</b> really should rest. Are you sure
    you’ll be fit to walk by <i>then?”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Absolutely! I’ve been waiting for this all semester! It’s going to be    <i>great!</i> Oh, that reminds me. Lucifer, are you going to, you know?”
    She discreetly pointed at Alecto, pushing him to ask her. He sighed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Alecto? Would you, <i>err, accompany</i> me to the dance?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…I’ve never been to a dance.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Me, neither.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “O-Okay. What do you do?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Selene began rambling. “Well, if it’s anything like a ball, you talk and
    sing, and there’s music, <i>and</i> you get to eat amazing food. And you
    make new friends! Oh, and you <i>dance! Duh!</i> And you can try on pretty
    dresses!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Okay!</i>
    I get it!” Alecto stuck her helm back on, flustered. “I accept, Lucifer.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Yay!”</i>
    Nadia clapped to Lucifer’s humiliation. Everyone turned tentatively, a
    batch of ruthless knocks indicating somebody at the door. Lucifer opened it
    to find nothing. It wasn’t until he looked down that he spotted a renegade
    envelope, and a bowl of fresh green ice-cream.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What is it?” Selene asked, unable to stand.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s a <b>letter, </b>and <i>this.”</i> Lucifer picked up both items.
    “Huh. It doesn’t say who it’s from.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Open it up!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He ripped the flimsy package open, and in addition to a hand-written recipe
for a type of desert titled the <i>Sweet Regale,</i> he glossed over    <i>another</i> page. One sentence was written in majestic cursive, on an
    otherwise blank sheet of paper. “…Ha. It’s for you, Selene.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    She read it out loud.
    <i>
        “Get well soon. From, Nomad.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Once night threatened to bring out the Grimm hordes, and sunlight did away
    with the same, Selene was finally back on her feet. First order of
    business, after dealing with the constant judgments from Lucifer that she
    should stay inside, was preparation. There wasn’t much time before the
    dance, and while she had an impressive repertoire of experience and
    outfits, Alecto understood she needed to part with her armor, even if she
    loathed the sentiment. Vale’s mall was the <i>perfect</i> battleground.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Are you sure you’re up to this, Selene? You <i>just</i> upgraded from the
    stretcher no more than an hour ago.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, this? This is <i>nothing.”</i> She proclaimed, though Alecto    <i>knew</i> she was limping for a reason. “I know you’re just trying to get
    out of this. But it’ll be fun, c’mon! I’ll be fine, so long as I have
    <i>
        this!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “And what is <i>this,</i> anyway?” Alecto dodged the hazardous flailing of
    Selene’s new cane. “I mean, I know what it is, but I’ve never seen a
walking stick like that. Usually they’re just <i>poles.</i> Not    <i>ornately engraved scepters.</i> It’s like the crutch equivalent of my
    sword.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hehee! If you must know, It’s not from <i>Vale.</i> Once family back home
    found out about what happened, they had it sent to me overnight. It’s
    pretty cool, huh? It’s really valuable, too. I can’t let <i>anything</i>
    happen to it. I’m fine, it’s just that walking <i>without</i> it is a bit
    uncomfortable.” Again, she downplayed her injury’s severity. “Oh, look!
    They have dresses over <i>there!”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ugh. I don’t have any idea what looks good and what doesn’t. When it comes
    to this kind of stuff, I don’t have good tastes.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t say that! Your armor is super pretty. If <i>anyone</i> here has
    tastes, it’s you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Y-You know I don’t handle compliments well.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Selene laughed. “Okay, okay. Look at <i>this</i> dress. Or this one. Which
    one speaks to you?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ew… Why are these all so <i>revealing?</i> Hardly a single one is
    appropriate for combat.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “This isn’t about combat. This is about fun!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto scanned the selection until she spotted a modest gown that matched
    her ash plating, with accents of her eye-color. “What about that? Looks
    good to me.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Told ya!</i>
    That’s one of my favorites!” Selene nudged her elbow and slipped it off the
    rack. “I think it’ll be a great fit, but there’s only one way to find out.
    The dressing room.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “S-So I have to take my armor off?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…” Selene slouched over, shocked at how insistent Alecto was. <i>“Duh!</i>
    What, are you planning to wear it over your armor? Get in there, it’s
    fine!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto grumbled, but complied. For a time Selene did nothing more than sit
    to ease some discomfort, and play her scroll. Then, <i>Maximus</i> tapped
    her shoulder. Instinctively, <i>Merlin</i> hopped out from under the cover
    of her dress, snarling.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hold it! I’m not here to fight you.” He raised his hands. “I may be many
things, duchess, but I’m not a cheater. I wouldn’t terrorize a    <i>cripple,</i> not that I have any bones worth picking.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-I’m not a cripple, but okay. Why did you seek me out <i>now?”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I wanted to, aha.” He scratched the back of his neck nervously. “I had
    brought Lucifer back after you did the whole<i> ‘skeleton hand’ </i>tantrum
    thing, and I kept the Grimm away when that guy with the antlers carried you
    to safety. Well, Nero helped, of course.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nero!? You’re not here for money, are you?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No, no, nothing like that.” Rubbing his hands deviously, he raised his
    eyebrows. “I was hoping that would be enough for me to make an apology
    worthwhile. Surely, you can let bygones be bygones, right?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…<i>Well.</i> I guess if you helped Lucifer, then that’s good enough for
    me. Thank you.” She nodded. The nearby door unlocked and creaked open,
    Alecto holding her suit in her hands like a baby. The dress fulfilled every
    requirement, though Alecto grew self-conscious with the prospect
    regardless.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What have you done?” She cried out. “To be so <i>exposed</i> in public!
    This is awful!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Aw, you look <i>amazing!”</i> Selene shut out her worries. “This is
    perfect!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Not yet. I couldn’t reach the ties in the back. Would you mind helping
    me?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Of course.” Selene fixed up the laces, securing the front.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Maximus whistled, impressed. “Who’s this, duchess? Your maid?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto swung her sword outward, not only knocking a deck of cards out of
his hands, but slicing each of them in two.    <i>“Hold your tongue, prude!”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“What the!?”</i>
    He scrambled down to pick them up. “Oh, that’s <i>real</i> nice. You know
how long it takes to get a perfect shuffle? Last time I buy anything    <i>‘indestructible’</i> from Nero… And this was one of my favorites, too.”
    He stood up, uselessly stuffing each of them into a pack. Everyone looked
    at each other awkwardly. “What? I can still return them, probably. You can
gawk at <i>each other.</i> Till next time, Selene. But, uh, yeah-    <i>whoever you are…”</i> He stopped, almost recognizing Alecto, pointing.
    Nothing came of it. “…Screw you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Can I put my suit back on, yet? And when I do, how am I supposed to pay
    for this? I don’t if you ever picked up on my situation, but I’m sort of in
    a money bind.” Alecto mentioned, following Selene to the cashier.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It can’t be that bad. How much lien do you have?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Zero.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “O-Okay! I can clear you, no problem. I’ll just have to convince Lucifer to
    add the amount. It won’t be hard, we have lots of money.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah, no kidding! Look at how expensive it is. I-I’ll find another one,
    it’s no problem-”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No, I <i>insist.”</i> Selene pulled her back. “My treat. Lucifer and I
    have no shortage of funds. If you think this is costly, you should see the
    prices in Atlas.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I need to <i>go</i> to Atlas sometime. What’s it like?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s great! It’s a little cold, especially during winter, but I think
    you’d love it! I can’t wait to go back, sometime.” She sighed. “S-Sorry.
    I’m just a little homesick.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Me, too. The Keraseer Kingdom was…
    <i>
        Unforgettable.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I promise after the Vytal Festival, we’ll take a trip to Atlas. Nadia can
    come, too. All four of us can go!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ha. Can’t wait.” Alecto closed her eyes. Just the fact that she was here
    in Vale, with all her team members was enough. Not <i>everything</i> worked
    out, but she could right the wrongs another time. Back at the dorm rooms,
    Nadia was training Lucifer in similar matters.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Sunset wasn’t present yet, but it wouldn’t be long. Night was the hard
    deadline.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You don’t <i>have</i> to be a gentlemen, most guys aren’t. But you need to
    at least <i>act</i> like one.” Nadia fixed the collar of Lucifer’s new
    costume. Not at all mechanical like the last one, this apparel was
something one would <i>expect</i> to see at a dance. “You certainly    <i>look</i> the part. Haha!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I try. N-Not on the looks. I <i>try</i> to be nice, I mean. Valor, some
    might call it.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It takes a little more than <i>that,</i> though. Gaining the acquaintance
    of a lady is hard work. You’ve already crossed that hurdle, but your whole
    attitude needs to change if you’re looking to fetch the affection of the
    average girl. Fortunately, I think it’s safe to say Alecto isn’t
    <i>
        that.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer wrangled with his tie, too agitated to sit still. “Nor am I the
    typical guy. I’ll give it my all, that much I can say. Just going out
    there without the suit is enough change for me. Besides, she’s <i>only</i>
    my partner for the dance. Just like Selene said. It doesn’t have to be
    romantic, or sweet.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “But is it?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Hmph. I’ll keep you guessing.”</i>
    He rolled his eyes. Nadia couldn’t read his poker face, if he was using one
    to begin with. “I know that’s what Selene would’ve liked for herself. She
    has nobody for the dance. Have to admire her independence like that.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nadia nodded, the two of them inspecting their reflection in the mirror.
    “True. Even if she was our age, there wouldn’t be anyone good enough for
    her, or <i>to</i> her.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Not to mention, she’d need the approval of Atlas.” He added. “You’re in much the same shoes.
    Did nobody try their luck with you?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Some</i>
    did.” She admitted. “I-I turned them down. I’m not very social. And… I
    promised my friend in Mistral.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “As long as it was your choice. How do
    I look?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “A little <i>tired.</i> Have you even slept since the incident?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Not much.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “W-Why don’t I get you some coffee?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Negative.” Lucifer said. “I don’t drink anything with caffeine.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What about…” Nadia opened her mouth to refute, remembering how every
    morning he’d bring coffee only to surrender it at Alecto’s request. There,
    the answer slunk. “So that was meant for <i>her</i> all this time?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t drink anything with caffeine.” He repeated.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So I <i>did</i> teach you something about chivalry. Then there’s not much
    I can improve upon. Just remember, as long as you smile, it’s going to be
    alright.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Let’s get going, then.” Lucifer held the door open.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A walk amongst the glower of stars had Lucifer waiting in front of the
    venue, stealing a swift peak at his watch whenever possible. As a
    consistent downpour of other students entered past him in pairs, the
    thought that he’d actually been stood up crept into the realm of
    possibility. It was more humorous than anything. But when Alecto finally
    emerged from the crowd to stand in front of him, he hadn’t even recognized
    her.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Lucifer? It’s me.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Alecto. I didn’t expect you to dress for the occasion. I’m surprised I did
    myself. Y-You look great.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You, too. I’m not really good at this whole dance thing, but…. I tried my
    best.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“I’d</i>
    say it was a success. After you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Mission accomplished!” Selene chuckled from the bushes, giddily giving
    Nadia a beat of failed high-fives. At the entrance, another patron of
    Beacon Academy greeted them, and logged them into the guestbook.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Gotcha all cleared up! Have fun!” The blonde waved, smiling.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “W-Wait a minute!” Alecto broke the elegant act. “You’re that <i>Yang</i>
girl! From Team <i>Ruby!</i> You had the chance to set up the dance, while    <b>I’m</b> stuck cleaning it all up!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Pay no attention to her. Pleasure to meet you.” Lucifer saluted and
    dragged Alecto away, covering her mouth to hide a string of reprehensible
    insults. Yang was left scratching her head, although with the next couple
    she simply shrugged and happily resumed her work.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Inside, the atmosphere was ripe for comradery. Happy happenings were to be
    had everywhere, from laughs to feasts to the upbeat tunes brought on by a
    talented band. Meticulous selection proved golden. On both floors, the
    spoils of a friendly gathering were felt. The heavy breathing of somebody
    who’d been missing for too long wisped past the necks of both Lucifer and
    Alecto.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Ah, my two star students! Pleasure to see you once again, Mister
        Virtus. And Miss Keraseer!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    They blurted. “Professor Stam!?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Aha, don’t act so surprised! I had some work offshore high on the
    itinerary, but I can’t remember the last time I missed the Beacon Dance, if
    I <i>ever</i> did! But I’m sure in my absence, Team Lance had a splendid
    time, no? Probably lounging in your dorms, playing games and enjoying good
    company, huh?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Aha.” Lucifer looked at Alecto, both of them reminiscing over the
    adventure despite their insistence to forget it. <i>“Something</i> like
    that.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Glad to hear it! Because now that I have returned, playtime is    <i>over!</i> We need to steer the class back on track! It’ll be a busy
    dozen sessions or so before the Vytal Festival, where I’ll let you off the
    hook.” Stam had a habit of shouting without realizing it.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What sort of work are we talking, here?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Great question! After a nice bit of research, I came upon a brilliant
sparring location, south of here! It’s a little known spot, you    <i>might’ve</i> heard of it. It’s called
    <b>
        Terra Insanire!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    They both jolted their heads, an expression of pure horror spreading
    between them. Alecto was first to denounce the idea, with an improvised
    string of falsehoods. “N-No! I mean, uh, we can’t go there!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Why?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “B-Because! The… White Fang is there!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No, I just confirmed for myself their whereabouts.” Stam laughed. “There
    isn’t a thing to worry about. Nobody’s at Terra Insanire.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Nobody?</i>
    Th-That’s right! <b>Nobody’s</b> at Terra Insanire! The swordsman Delphic
    is hiding out there!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He is!?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yes!” Another lie. “Boreas spotted him through there on a routine resource
    gather. You can’t go there without putting the students in grave danger.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Enough of these games.”</i>
    Lucifer silenced her. “You can’t go into Terra Insanire because the only
    route through is Servus Portum. Case closed.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah! What he said.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well, that is a conundrum indeed.” Stam admitted. “Good work Mister
    Virtus! I should’ve expected nothing less from a tactical prodigy than to
    shoot down a poorly conceived plan. Extra credit for you!”

    “Grr!” Alecto stomped both her feet, jealous.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nonetheless, I wouldn’t want to hold either of you up for the occasion! I
    have my own work here, regardless. Proceed!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The crowd, though it fanned out, still grew claustrophobic. The only solace
    was the outskirts, which also happened to be the best spot for those
    looking to satisfy their <i>hunger.</i> Wise catering choices were
    absolute. But more importantly, Beleth had coincidentally set up the space
    as a pardon from the blaring music and chatter.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh. Alecto! Looking glamorous as always. And who’s your new friend?” He
    nodded at a comparatively vulnerable, unveiled Lucifer. “Dashing, I must
    say. Don’t tell me! An exchange student from a neighboring kingdom, am I
    right? Anyway, have either of you seen Lucifer anywhere?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Ugh.”</i>
    He sighed, holding his forehead. He then lifted one hand upward. “At your
    service.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Wait. There… There’s a <i>person</i> under the armor? Like, a human?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Yes?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So you’re <i>not</i> a cognizant suit?” Beleth, utterly shocked, covered
    his mouth. “I-I genuinely thought ‘<i>Lucifer’</i> was like an Atlesian
    android that gained sentience… I’m kidding! Liven up a little.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Ugh.” Lucifer scorned as Rade pushed him aside for private affairs.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Ack, Beleth! You think we’d ruin Lucifer’s electronics if we try the    <i>‘hand-in-a-bowl-of-water’</i> trick late at night? Ol’ nuts and bolts
might take a trip, but I’m not sure I want to short out his circuits    <i>just</i> yet.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“For the love of... </i>
    How many people here <i>actually</i> think I’m a robot?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You mean Lucifer? Pretty much all of them. Do you know something about him
    we don’t?” Rade munched down popcorn, barely aware of his surroundings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well actually… No.” Lucifer began to reap the benefits of false
    information. “He’s really just an android, like you said. In fact, he was
    recently programmed to have a special roving mode. So make sure you leave
    him alone, because now he’ll automatically vaporize anyone who comes within
    two feet of him.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto hit him in the shoulder. She had to hold back though, considering
    her request. “Hey, could you go get some punch, or something? You too,
    Rade? I-I’d like to have a word in private with Beleth.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You heard her. Scram.” Beleth chuckled. Begrudging compliance was all they
    could ask for. “What do you need, Alecto?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-I’m sorry. About that whole war, you know? I just want to tie up every
    loose end, and make everything like it used to be.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Done.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So you’re not mad?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well, actually, I’m <i>furious.”</i> If he was lying, his jovial attitude
    wasn’t helping. “But Rade says it best. No use holding grudges. As long as
    you’re not still plotting my death, I’d say it’s settled. I’d best take a
    page out of his book.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’ll do <i>nothing</i> of the sort!” Rade said, hiding the Fear Index.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m still not <i>fully</i> over Delphics! But… In trying to avenge my old
    family, I nearly tore apart my current one.” Alecto looked away, guilty.
    “But when I get my hands on <i>Nobody,</i> he’ll be begging for mercy. I
    can make an exception for you though, on one condition. I want you to take
    off your blindfold, and stop hiding who you <i>really</i> are.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I can’t do that. Do you think I <i>like</i> keeping a secret like this?
    I’d never be looked at the same.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Not many people know who a Delphic is, Beleth. You’d be looked at no
    different than Rade. And everyone loves <i>him.</i> And for those that do
    know, if <i>I</i> can get over it, so can they.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Um… So long it means we can move past this. I’ll throw away the blindfold
    first thing tonight. I promise. But first, I have a performance!” Beleth
    clapped.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Performance? W-What are you talking about?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Didn’t you know? I’m <i>part</i> of the entertainment tonight. I’ve been
    booked for <i>weeks!”</i> He collected his bow and violin. “So it’s pretty
    lucky we escaped Terra Insanire when we did. Anyway, thanks for
    understanding!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s not fair! I’m basically the janitor for this entire thing, and
    you’re the entertainment!” He didn’t even hear her, having sprinted off to
    meet with faculty on a nearby stage. Alecto was left to hum alone, until
    Lucifer returned.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Here’s your punch. There were many different kinds, so I just mixed them.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Befuddled with such stupidity, she stared inquisitively. “…Thanks.” Once
    Beleth had begun playing a song, which rightly consisted of slow, soft
    melodies, several of the couples began dancing with each other. Lucifer
    held his hand out.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So, do you… Want to dance?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ha.” Alecto swiped his hand down. “What, you want to <i>waltz?</i> I can’t
    dance! At least, not like that. I’m not
    <i>
        Selene.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Thank god for that.”</i>
    He grumbled. She tried to hit his arm a second time, though he parried it.
    Again, she tried. He dodged. This continued in good faith, both of them
hopping back and forth, Lucifer eventually laughing. “You know, this isn’t    <i>too</i> different from a dance. And in that respect, you’re not bad. Not
    bad at all.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Course not. I’ve always outshined you in combat!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Do I need to remind you of that duel on the Nevermore?” Lucifer grabbed
    Alecto’s hand and spun her around. Their tango brought them past the rest
of Team Lance. <i>Their</i> giggles didn’t last. The blue, virtual    <b>Ella</b> ambushed them, hugging Nadia from the side.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nadia! You’re back!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Gah! Ella! You’re okay!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Why didn’t you come back sooner?” She pouted. “Where have you been all
    this time?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Selene, leaning on her scepter, spoke for them both. “We <i>wanted</i> to
    return. But we were trapped in a place called Terra Insanire. I’m just
    grateful we escaped when we did.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Me, too. So much has happened since we last met. I-I went to Forever Fall,
    and fought with Augustus against Servus Portum! And I met another friend.
    Augustus would’ve come, but he said the Administrator ordered against it.
    So my new friend brought me here! In a way, he’s a lot like you, Nadia.
    Except he has horns, and wear’s bandages- oops! I’m not supposed to talk
    about him. Forget I said anything.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nomad?” Selene contemplated. “How? He doesn’t even know you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It <i>was</i> Nomad.” Ella led along Selene’s confusion. She realized that
    Nomad, <i>whoever he was,</i> would be the perfect cover for an Oathkeeper.
    “He saved me from Terrance.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Terrance?” Nadia said. “Is that why he’s missing? Did something happen
    while we were gone?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Y-Yes. He tried to turn me, Augustus, and Zara into a General from Servus
    Portum.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Caligula? </i>
    That couldn’t be.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
Nero caught wind of the conversation, and he figured since he was    <i>there</i>, his opinion held weight. “No, not Caligula. It was Victor.
    And as much as it pains me to admit it, Terrance turned his back on us. I
    don’t know why, but his betrayal is without question… As a teammate, he was
    a great friend. Genuine. There must be something else afoot. <i>Boreas</i>
    would be able to figure it out.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m sure Portum has intelligence on the other side.” Zara passively
    mentioned. “Who knows? Maybe if Boreas can make it out through Aamon’s
    domain, the two can combine their efforts, and crack the case. I wouldn’t
    put it past either.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ha. I’m sure they’ll come up with something. Certainly love to pick them
    apart myself. I bet one of those humanoid drones is worth a pretty penny.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Aye. Nero.” Maximus snuck up from behind. “Turns out they’re selling pins
    back near the entrance. Which logo do you want? Beacon’s, or the Vytal
    Festival’s?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The cheaper of the two.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “They’re giving away <i>pins?</i> I want four of each!” Selene ran away, as
    best she could, leading a mass of other students to do the same. On the way
    there, for everyone but Zara, Penelope’s lapse in snores due to the
    commotion was lost to Beleth’s encore.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Professor? Sorry for interrupting you. It won’t be a problem to go back to
    sleep, will it?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Penelope leaned back in her chair. “Certainly not. If anything, the problem
    is <i>too</i> much sleep. I should be thanking you, really. I hope you’re
    enjoying the dance. It’s my first as well, personally. At least, for
    <i>
        Beacon Academy.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s lovely. And I wanted to thank you as well. Without you, I’d still
    know next to nothing about Servus Portum. You’re part of why Team Lance and
    Blazer is here. I couldn’t ask more of a professor.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If it means helping you, and hindering Servus Portum, I’d do anything. But
    besides you and your friends, was anyone else saved? Was Aamon involved in
    any way?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “At my request. He’s an ally, truly. There was also Troy, the travelling
    merchant. And Eleanor, the knight Alecto holds in such high regard. And
    from what I heard, even <b>Nomad</b> made an appearance. He’s a long-time
    friend from the
    <i>
        White Fang.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“I-Impossible!”</i>
    Penelope gasped.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You know of Nomad?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“It doesn’t matter who he is, not a soul from the White Fang can    <i>ever</i> be a friend.<i> I-I learned that firsthand…”</i> She began to
pass out, the pause in tiredness ending.    <i>“The White Fang can never be trusted…” </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    As if it was planned, Beleth’s soothing song ended in sync with Penelope’s
    energy. When he was done, he stepped off the stage to catch a breath.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That was amazing!” Lexy applauded, one of the few settled down to watch
    him. “Somehow, you always manage to do better than before. The only
    downside is that since it’s <i>you</i> playing it, we can’t dance to your
    own music.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Is this your way of asking me for a dance?” He remarked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Maybe.</i>
    That depends. Would you say yes?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I think so.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Then let’s do it!” She grabbed him by the shoulder and dragged him onto
    the miniature stadium. “C’mon, it can’t be that hard! Just perform the
    footwork I see you do during a fight.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So you want him to attack you?” Rade slipped between them, a dense grin
    plain for all to witness. “You could’ve just asked
    <i>
        me.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Get out of here!” Lexy pushed him aside. He flipped himself head over
    heels, landing with a crackle of groans as though he was pretending he
    broke both his legs. Lexy and Beleth resumed their shuffle, appearing far
    more elegant and unified than that of Lance. Lucifer and Alecto continued
    trading metaphorical blows, playing off of each other’s movements, until
    they settled with the rest of their team.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Wow. This is tiring.” Lucifer sighed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What? That was great! I’m barely even winded! Ha!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I guess I’m just terrible then, huh?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The self-deprecating approach to Alecto’s badgering was fresh, so much so
    that she had no choice to concede. “Well, I’m not trying to say you’re
    <i>
        terrible.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How kind.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How do I always end up outsmarted by you?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So you admit it, then?” Lucifer ridiculed. “You’re always outsmarted by
    me. Fantastic.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He braced himself for the incoming tackle. And he wasn’t disappointed in
    the slightest. Nadia was the one responsible for stopping her strangling
    him, tugging her off the floor. “You two can make out later.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “N-No! It wasn’t like that!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer laughed at her embarrassment. “Good lord. See what happens?” Merlin
    helped him up with Selene’s cane.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto ridiculed. “Grr! Keep it up Nadia, and you’ll be next, after I
    finish with him!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Teehee! You can’t destroy me. You <i>know</i> I must make it to Soulcess.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah. But what if an accident happens. Say, you get fatally sick or
    something. I bet the Soulcess won’t carry you through <b>that.”</b>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Deal. How much you betting?” Nadia smirked. “This is a tradition passed
    down through eras, basically, and I think I know a <i>little</i> more about
    it than you. You really are confident enough to question the Soulcess?”
    <p>

    “I wish. I’m not Lady <i>Hestia.</i> Nor Lord <i>Keres</i> for that matter.
    Just a Descendant. But since the Soulcess comes every century, it’s
    impossible for any of us to surpass an age of one hundred years. A natural
    death is the same plus one. This ensures every Amaryllis makes it in time.
    Of course, in a perfect world every Amaryllis would be born at the end of
    each Soulcess. I-I’m unfortunate in that regard. Mine comes at age-”

    <i>“Thirty.</i>
    We’d never forget.” Lucifer’s hasted voice returned. No matter what though,
    it could never capture the modification offered by his mask.

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Thanks. So to answer your question, <i>yes.</i> I’m immune to sickness.
    I’m also immune to heart attacks, strokes, basically every natural method
    of death. How wonderful for us all.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Thirty is more time than we could ever ask for to be with you!” Selene
    puffed her cheeks.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>

    “Same for me.” Nadia closed her eyes in bliss, encouraging the hugs she was
    receiving.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Even Lucifer participated. “Is Ella tuned into any of this? As an
    Amaryllis, it’s sort of important to know.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Unlike me, she doesn’t age. I’m not sure if that’ll play a part come the
    Soulcess, but I don’t want to start guessing when she asks questions. I’ll
    tell her when the time comes. When she’s ready.”

    The dance couldn’t end <i>late</i> enough. Even those that thought this
    affair a hollow gathering were enjoying themselves. The affection between
    Lance was underplayed if anything, compared to other teams. Cheers, more
    hugs, and merriment were a common thread throughout the night. The ending
    was bittersweet.
    <p>

<p>
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    Beacon’s numbers slowly dwindled, eventually reaching single digits by
    midnight. Even Ella was eventually taken away by Augustus. The
    participants, now long gone, didn’t seem very charitable. The place was a
    mess. Spilled drinks, chairs strewn about, and decorations scattered due to
    neglect and time.

    Professor Stam sat out of his beach chair, stretching. “Alright, Team
    Lance. I expect these grounds to look ship-shape by tomorrow morning! I’d
    suggest getting to work quickly. If you all combine your efforts, I’m sure
    you’ll be fulfilled knowing you did your best soon enough. And who knows-
    I’m not opposed to handing out more extra credit <i>yet.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Done!”</i>
    Alecto shouted. Her enthusiasm swiftly folded backwards when she finally
    started, though. And Stam was already gone, probably on the other side of
    Beacon at this point. “Ugh. Why’d they make so much mess?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>

    “Hey, let’s turn that frown upside down!” Rade leaned down to stay at her
    eye-level.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Oh yeah? Then why don’t you help me instead of watching, you    <i>gangly little dweeb!”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Exactly! That’s what I’m looking for! The fire in your eyes! Not that it
    compares to <b>yours,</b> sweetie!” He reached over and pulled <i>Zara</i>
    to his side. “Go on. Get cleaning.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How about I beat you over the head instead?” She said.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hey!” Alecto barked. “Now that, I can get behind. Have at you!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If we’re going to spar, why not go four versus four? For old times’ sake?” Rade said.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, a Team challenge!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Team challenge?”</i>
    Lucifer returned from the hallways. “You want to fight them?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Why not?” Beleth slapped his back. “I’ve been waiting for another friendly
    fight! Some good practice for the Vytal Festival! Ready your soprano,
    because I’m about to hear you sing!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Without needing commands, each member of the two factions lined up on
    either side of the establishment. Lifted by Royal Necrocyst, Selene now
    rested in its palm with Merlin on her lap. A rocket-locker blasted through
the double doors. Inside, the absolute pinnacle of    <i>nostalgia, strength,</i> and <i>power</i> was swung into Alecto’s hands.
    It was the long dormant <b>Keraseer Heirloom,</b> shining gold.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Yes! How I missed you!”</i>
    She nurtured it in her arms. When she pointed it forward, she had one last
    thing to say. “Say, Beleth? Your performance is over. Remember our
    promise?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He paused, then proudly untied his blindfold, aiming for the trash.
    Instead, it landed at Nero’s feet. “Hey! That’s littering! I bet someone
    some where’s dying to pay the right price for this! And what’s this? You
    weren’t going to fight each other without us, were you!?” Nero began
    unravelling his flail at Beleth’s command.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Trying to hide the cards, are we? That won’t fly!” <i>Maximus</i> galloped
    to Lucifer’s side. The two once contentious compeers now held their backs
    to each other without a second thought. Team Lance and Blazer with their
    respective allies charged at each other laughing, with palpable smiles
    visible everywhere.

<p>
    Far to the east, on the unexplored beaches of Summit’s Blight, away from
    the carnage of Servus Portum’s relentless assault, Nomad passed through.
    Following the crash of waves, he’d come onto a rock recliner. He knew who
    sat upon it. The ocean could not be seen at any distance. Even inside the
    congealed water. There was simply too much fog. That didn’t stop the
    sea-wide flashes of lightning from breaking the horizon.
    <p>

    assumed the shape he was addressing to be an

    Nomad began skipping stones. He couldn’t see far enough to throw correctly,
    not that he was experienced to begin with. “But why? If she wants Beacon to
    fall, chasing me is a waste of time. Even Nobody is hesitant to aid her.”
