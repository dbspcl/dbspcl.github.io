Artemis was completely exhausted, consumed most of all by fear of those <em>tablets</em> which presaged an apocalyptic crisis. And now,    <em>vengeance</em> had been added to the mix. Aku was gone, but she’d
    pinpointed his location without a lead once before. To avenge a Keraseer,
    she’d do it again.
</p>
<p>
    “Sister Artemis? I-It’s alright. It’s just me.” Diana inquisitively entered
    the chateau, where the murals reached their highest and the walls were
    polished to perfection. “I was just curious… Are you doing okay?”
</p>
<p>
    “What? Of course. Please, don’t worry about a thing.” She was thankful her
    helmet hid the bags under her eyes. She had opted not to rest during the
    last new moon. Every hour that ticked by without resolution was one that
    shouldn’t be wasted. She couldn’t sleep, anyway.
</p>
<p>
    “Are you sure?”
</p>
<p>
    “…Thank you for asking. I’ll manage just fine. But you see, the more time
that passes without action on our part, the greater a threat Trajan    <em>will</em> pose.”
</p>
<p>
“I know, I know. But remember, I’m still stuck on the <em>Herald Transcripts</em>. Am I allowed to know why we can’t just    <em>stop</em> Trajan? You guys are the greatest warriors in Remnant,
    right?”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“You are, too…”</em>
    Artemis swept aside her mountain of graphs and paid full attention to the
question. “But it’s a little more complicated than that. And we    <em>are</em> in a situation never discussed in law. Perhaps it’s against
    standard procedure, but… With how splintered we are, this may be the first
    steps of fixing things. Okay.”
</p>
<p>
    “I’ll keep it a secret!”
</p>
<p>
“The <strong>War of the Second Bewitchment</strong> was <em>technically</em> a success for us, the good guys- you should’ve known    <em>that</em> by now. But it came at price only high ranking Descendants
    comprehend. Lord Keres, Lady Hestia, and Lady Clotho had no choice, so in
keeping us safe and exiling one god, they had to sacrifice    <em>themselves,</em> too. There was no way to figure out the fourth of
    their council was a Delphic, and in allowing him to carry on in this way,
    Trajan could return with revenge in his soul. All gods paid for the sins of
    just <em>one.”</em>
</p>
<p>
    Diana tilted her head. “But isn’t <em>Kyradin Bael</em> still here? Wasn’t
    he the fifth and final member of the High Council? What let <em>him</em>
    live through the Second Bewitchment?”
</p>
<p>
    “The Arbiter is the only <em>faunus</em> who resided among the four.
    Neither divine nor mortal, it seems he predated us all. One can only guess
    what life was like back then.”
</p>
<p>
    “What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
    In order to better lay out the lore, she started sketching out the events
    on a sheet of parchment. “The First Bewitchment was brought on by two
    primordial beings, the <em>Dark Brothers,</em> who grew wary of mankind’s
    love of warfare and betrayal. So, naturally, they brought an <em>end</em>
to civilization. Four gods were left in the event something-    <em>anything,</em> remained. But Lord Keres, Lady Hestia, Lady Clotho, and
    Trajan would go on to destroy <em>themselves,</em> too. Kyradin Bael was
    never meant to exist beyond the First Bewitchment.”
</p>
<p>
Diana gasped.    <em> “You mean to tell me he’s from the age of the Dark Brothers?”</em>
</p>
<p>
    “…I would guess, indeed. Don’t you see? The start of three bloodlines had
    to forfeit their endless lives, and one Relic, to eradicate Trajan when he
    tried to replicate his creator’s greatest spell.” Artemis stood up. Simply
    describing what she already knew was enough to accelerate her heartbeat.
    “Should he ever come back, three of <strong>us</strong> would need to do
    the same. Only a Descendant is ripe for the banishing ritual,
    <em>
and if we do not stop him, he will summon onto Remnant the        <strong>Third</strong> Bewitchment.
    </em>
    Not only was the location of every Relic scattered at the end of the War
    for the <em>Second</em> Bewitchment, nobody in Clotho’s Coven is to die. I
    won’t allow it!”
</p>
<p>
    “But if so, humanity will perish. W-What do we do?”
</p>
<p>
    The answer gave Artemis a reinvigorated sense of passion. There was no
    chance of throwing in the towel, now. “We won’t let Trajan return! There
    are but three things to do. Discover Xiasma! Retrieve the Rhinestone, or
Whetstone, and destroy them! And place the elusive<strong> <em>Forgotten Brazier</em></strong> under strict lock and key! One    <em>cannot</em> resurrect Trajan without that missing shrine.”
</p>
<p>
    Mania, cradling something obscured with a bundle of cloth, slowly
    approached. “I thought this information was reserved for those who’ve
    reached the <em>highest</em> levels of Kingdom Lore. Why tell the youngest
    now?”
</p>
<p>
    “What? What difference does it make, at this point? She needs to know.”
</p>
<p>
    “Weren’t you the <em>strictest</em> when it came to honoring the code? Only
    those most devoted to the Coven are worthy of its puzzles, and Diana is far
    too young for you to impart knowledge of this esteem. Look, when something
    doesn’t add up, it’s almost always subterfuge.”
</p>
<p>
    “As always, you’re the only one who can be right about something…” Artemis
grumbled. “Times have changed, Sister. Descendants are <strong>dying, </strong>and the Trajaneer is still free. The    <em>‘code’ </em>has been suspended until we can get this situation under
    control. It’s my duty to keep us together, and that’s final.”
</p>
<p>
    Diana tried to diffuse the situation. Had Mania not pressed onward, she
    would’ve succeeded. “I-It’s alright. I’ll catch up with the books really
    quickly, I promise!”
</p>
<p>
    “But you can’t just <em>break</em> a cherished tradition. Nobody has that
    right- not even you. What’s going on here, really? Don’t lie, now. This is
    important.”
</p>
<p>
    Artemis mocked the very concept, waving away Mania. “Are you accusing me of
    being Xiasma, again? Please. The implications that I would aid Trajan is
    profane. It’s <em>ridiculous.</em> It’s <strong><em>heresy,</em></strong>
    of the highest order! I started the Coven.”
</p>
<p>
    “…No, you didn’t. Lady Clotho did.”
</p>
<p>
    “But <strong>I</strong> was the <em>first-“ </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>“And you are <strong>not</strong> the first member.”</em>
    Mania dumped the contents of her bag onto the ground, a pile of never
    before seen books spilling open. Most of them were stamped with the sigil
    of Grimm. “Mind explaining why these were hidden for so many centuries?”
</p>
<p>
    “You were in my room!?” Artemis’ frantically attempted to scoop the texts
    up and off the shining floor.
</p>
<p>
“So, you’re not above keeping secrets. Traitorous, I’d say. How about    <em>you,</em> Sister Diana? Her plot starts with putting the title of
Xiasma on me, doesn’t it? But you forgot <em>one</em> thing. I’m    <strong>smarter-</strong> <em>much</em> smarter, than any of you. I’ll put
    a stop to this before it can even begin.”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Watch your tone, Sister Mania.”</em>
    Artemis commanded. Her stature grew larger, and her voice suddenly echoed.
    <em>
        “Never before has war been waged with me, or any member of the Coven,
        in this sanctuary. Cease this madness at once.”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Diana tried a second time. “Wait, please! We can still fix this! I’m
    sorry!” Again, she was denied by Mania.
</p>
<p>
    “Get behind me, Diana. This ends with her! She’s the traitor!” The Scythe
    was brandished. “For you see, the contents of these books is enough to ruin
    you, Artemis. <em>Shame if word of them were to ever leave this room.</em>
I’m disgraced myself, and <em>I’m</em> not the one who overthrew the    <strong>true</strong> first member of the Coven, and hid away every record
    of him: <em>A man, by the name of Agramon? Ring any bells?”</em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>“Silence!”</em></strong>
    Artemis screamed, aiming her bow and firing in less time than Mania could
    reasonably react. The arrow whizzed past a startled Diana, and struck her
    in the shoulder, driving her into one of the lavish dining thrones.
</p>
<p>
    Everyone else, at the first sign of discord, blasted through the doors with
    their weapons ready. Immediately, Eleanor had seen enough, already drawing
    conclusions. <em>“Sister Artemis! Have you lost your mind!?”</em>
</p>
<p>
    Even the <em>black vultures</em> waited an uncomfortable amount of time for
    an answer. “I… Perhaps I <em>have.</em> Forgive me.” Artemis nearly dropped
    her bow, now sprinting away, shaking.
</p>
<p>
    “Wait!” Eleanor was ready to give chase. “Are you guys going to help, or
    just stand there?” None could deny the implications of Artemis using her
    weapon on another outside of training, except Eos, who followed to the
    gossip of the rest.
</p>
<p>
    Once outside, Abigor was the only one who could get her to halt. Equipped
    with only a bouquet meant for Demeter, he expected an expedient trip. But
    Eleanor had to take a break from running, anyway. “Is there something the
    matter?”
</p>
<p>
    “It’s Sister Artemis. Something pushed her to turn on us, and now she’s
    gone. She might be the traitor. I don’t know, anymore.”
</p>
<p>
    “What? She <em>just</em> ran past me. Wouldn’t even <em>answer</em> me.
    Calm down.”
</p>
<p>
    “No. I have to see where she goes. Leave me.”
</p>
<p>
    “Hold on a moment. Think about this rationally. She’ll return on her own
    terms-” Abigor said.
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Leave me alone!”</em>
    She broke away and continued following the tracks. Eos didn’t acknowledge
    him, and did the same. Eleanor could hold her own well enough, as an
    assailant, but fighting remained a dangerous prospect without someone to
    play defense. She prayed Artemis wouldn’t force her hand.
</p>
<p>
    Abigor sighed, rolled his eyes, and then continued the chase himself. The
    flowers stayed behind.
</p>
<p>
    He kept on their trail, whistling, fighting off insects, eventually
    skipping stones when Eleanor spent a few minutes investigating an isolated
    Nomadic Outpost, feverishly stoking the feeling of monotony. “Why don’t you
    try talking to the <em>birds,</em> huh?”
</p>
<p>
    “Her vultures are gone.” Eos claimed. “Either she’s called them off, or
    they’re no longer hers to control. Neither options bode well.”
</p>
<p>
“Ever notice how it’s always a <em>terrible curse,</em> or a    <em>dire plot,</em> or something <em>‘doesn’t bode well.’ </em>Nobody ever
    says
    <em>
        ‘Oh, Abigor, my dearest friend, we thank you for constant loyalty, and
        we offer you ten-thousand gold on <strong>this</strong> day, where
        there will most certainly <strong>not</strong> be a terrible tragedy.’</em> Funny how that is, right?”
</p>
<p>
    “…I could state your suggestion right <em>now,</em> if you’d like.”
</p>
<p>
    Abigor shook his head, now bemused. “If only words held such value. How
    about you? We just need a good break. A good <em>day.” </em>
</p>
<p>
    “If I dwelled on each day that went by, I’d have gone insane before
    half-time of the first year. I live for the hour, more or less. So, you
    could say it’s been a rough <em>hour.</em> I’m too old for this,
literally.” She explained, bringing him to chuckle.    <em>“Stop laughing.” </em>
</p>
<p>
    “That reminds me. There was something at the lost lair of <em>Aku-”</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Do not say that name.” </em>
</p>
<p>
    Abigor flinched for show. “Aha. The lair of <em>that Delphic.</em> I came
    to help, but also to tell you something really important.”
</p>
<p>
    “It can wait.” When bored, which was most of the time, Eos’ habit of
    speaking in forceful, choppy sentences never grew old.
</p>
<p>
    “I’m… Not so sure. Herald is <em>not</em> the good friend you see him as.
    This entire time, he’s been using connections to gain dominance over
    Tormentyst. We <em>found</em> the Beryl Rhinestone, only to have him abuse
    the <em>‘Old Arts’</em> so he could run away with it. I can only guess
    where it’s gone at this point, and even though its <em>location’s</em>
    changed, Herald’s goals likely haven’t.”
</p>
<p>
    “Impossible.” Eos said.
</p>
<p>
    “But it’s true, and that’s bad news for us. Troy could tell you himself. I
learned firsthand the use of these Relics. Don’t you see? Herald actually <em>found</em> one, set a Grimm the size of a building free, and challenged    <em>Troy and me,</em> all to steal <strong>Tormentyst.</strong> Isn’t this
    important? The Rhinestone is in play, and Diana could be in danger.”
</p>
<p>
    Eleanor interrupted. “She is locked in a fortress with two guardians at the
    front gate. For now, <em>nothing</em> is more important than Sister
    Artemis’ safe return. It’s not that I don’t believe you, but all we can do
    is divide and conquer. We’ll organize an investigation into Herald as soon
    as we’re all together again.”
</p>
<p>
    “Then, mind clueing me in? What <em>did</em> Artemis do?” Abigor said.
</p>
<p>
    “She attacked us! Is it really that hard to understand?”
</p>
<p>
    “Well, yeah. Nothing like this has ever happened before. <em>Why</em> did
    she do it?”
</p>
<p>
    Eleanor stopped, now shouting in a cloudy, abandoned town of dead
    champions. Pieces of their armor were scattered along the dry land.
    Artemis’ tracks had all but vanished, and now they were only wandering
aimlessly. “I don’t know! Now go. How many times do I have to tell you?    <em>This is no longer your concern.</em> I should’ve kept you out of this
    the <em>moment</em> Trajan entered the picture.”
</p>
<p>
    “What is it, huh? Is it because I’m <em>human? </em>We were given choice
    for a reason, Eleanor. None can deny that, even if born with blood like
    yours.” Abigor crossed him arms.
</p>
<p>
“It was <strong>I</strong> who kept your kind safe till this point. It was    <em>us</em> who allowed you to get <em>this</em> far, to escape the
persecution of Grimm. Hundreds of years of wisdom and experience, and <em>still</em> you fools question our leadership.    <em>This is beyond you. Abandon your pride!” </em>
</p>
<p>
    Before he could provide an answer, a Grimm offered one of its own. The
    terrible growl signaled a foe beyond the likes of a simple Beowolf.
    Instinctively, the three formed a triangular formation, and Abigor slid
    Eos’ spiritual dagger into his hands, leaving his sword with his men with
    the intention of a <em>peaceful</em> voyage. He should’ve kept his
    expectations in check.
    <em>
        “…Without pride, we are nothing but meat, waiting until it’s time to
        become worms in the ground. This is not living. You should learn that,
        now.”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Of the chest pieces and leggings and <em>chainmail</em> skewed about, some
    of each swirled around, creating a hurricane of steel, only to come
    together above them and crash down. Thankfully they dodged, but the
    elements of a warrior came together thereafter, and a ghoul knight with no
    physical body rose from the dust.

    “I see. We’ve fought this enemy once before. It has terrorized these lands
    for far too long. It’s the same Grimm from the Keraseer Kingdom.” Abigor
    studied his opponent relentlessly, spotting the emblem of a Geist.
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Lady Demeter…”</em>
    Eleanor remembered very well, and used those awful memories as ammunition.
</p>
<p>
    The suit of armor assembled correctly at first, but would send pieces of
    itself in random directions at undeterminable intervals, until eventually
    the battle morphed into an unconventional game of dodging aimless metal.
    The break in pattern was sudden, the humanoid strategy returning,
    accentuated with the use of rusted pikes or maces from the corpses of those
    whose body wasn’t desecrated. And here, they thought they’d seen it all.
</p>
<p>
    The Grimm eventually managed this confusion into a flurry that took away
    Eleanor’s aura, and threw her into Eos. It caught Eleanor’s ageless sword
and bent it into a ball of twisted metal. Though greatly amused, the    <em>owner</em> of the weapon cried out in horror.
</p>
<p>
    Abigor took the chance, slashing with all his might from behind. Not
    willing to be outdone, the armor dodged instinctively, losing limbs in
    order to preserve its symbol- the weak spot of any Geist. Eos finally
    recovered, overjoyed at the sounds of tearing alloy. But when she looked
    over, she witnessed the ruse in full, as the other piles of plating came
    under a dark influence and restrained Abigor.
</p>
<p>
    “No. My axe!” She fumbled around in trepidation, spotting it under a
    mountain of enchanted gloves. It seemed more than <em>one</em> outfit could
    be haunted, and this tactic would stall long enough.
</p>
<p>
    Abigor could only stare down his enemy, as the Geist revealed itself and
ensnared a gooey web around his body.    <em>“Wait! Stop! N-No! I have so much more to give!” </em>Too late.
    Apathetic to begging, the archfiend absorbed what was left of any
    constitution.
</p>
<p>
    As Abigor <em>died,</em> the Geist’s mind wandered, and suddenly it favored
    a <em>new</em> form, choosing to channel inside his body. With countless
    lifespans of experience, and a host as formidable as Abigor <em>was,</em>
    the Wraith was born- a horrific combination of man and Grimm at both their
    best. Eleanor screamed, trying to deny what was happening. The nightmare
    progressed. So enamored with the prospect of a human vessel, the Geist had
    no plans to <em>ever</em> leave.
</p>
<p>
“You must make a stand!” Eos hauled Eleanor up. They could both cry    <em>later.</em> “Abigor is no more, but he will <em>not</em> be forgotten.
    Do you hear me, Eleanor? Without you, neither of us will survive. Make good
    of his sacrifice. <em>Wake up. Wake up! Please.” </em>
</p>
<p>
    First, Wraith <strong>screeched.</strong> This was a power not felt since
    its inception. Eos let Eleanor wallow in misery, and braced for impact. Her
    powerful strikes extended the duel, but her greatest asset of unmatched
    dexterity was rendered useless against Wraith’s new claws. <em>Nothing</em>
    could withstand them, and her aura depleted in seconds.
</p>
<p>
    The tipping point came when Wraith <em>slithered through the walls,</em>
    and grappled for the weapon. Eos almost laughed. She’d been outmatched the
entire fight, but now her enemy had focused all efforts on raw    <em>strength,</em> where she reigned absolutely supreme. Shortly, Eos let
    the rage inside, and pushed back with everything, roaring. There, she fell
    into the trap.
</p>
<p>
    The Geist retreated for but a moment, leaving Abigor’s limp body as a
    scarecrow. It swooped around, and jammed its nails into Eos’ back.
</p>
<p>
    “No!” She pleaded, falling to her knees. The Wraith loomed overhead and
    graciously licked its lips with an elongated, dripping tongue.
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Die!”</em>
    Eleanor stabbed it repeatedly through the back with Eos’ polearm, gritting
her teeth at the shower of dark liquid.    <em>“Die! Die! <strong>Die!</strong> You bastard!” </em>
</p>
<p>
    Once she was finished, the Wraith convulsed in a pool of its own bile, but
    it was <em>still</em> alive.
</p>
<p>
    “…I knew you’d return. That was too close.” Eos struggled to stand. “Finish
    the job, quickly, while we have the chance.”
</p>
<p>
Eleanor backed away from Wraith, her hands trembling.    <em>“Abigor… I’m sorry.” </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Make haste!” </em>
</p>
<p>
“…No. He’s Grimm but… He was my best friend.” She sobbed.    <em>“Oh, Abigor. This is all my fault. You left me no choice!”</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        “E-Eleanor! It’s a <strong>Grimm!</strong> It only purpose is to die at
        our hand! What’s done is done. Give me back my axe, or do as your god
        commands, and have your revenge!”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “I won’t. I <em>can’t.” </em>Eleanor defiantly stepped away, holding the
    axe back. Sooner or later, Wraith would recover.
</p>
<p>
“None would ever refuse, unless… No. You’re Xiasma.” Eos gasped, disarmed.    <em>“You’re Xiasma…”</em>
</p>
<p>
    Hardly believing it, she limped away when Eleanor held a hand out, the hurt
    in both their hearts cutting deep. So, they ran in opposite directions
    while Wraith simply <em>laughed,</em> wiping its mouth of blood with a
    shredded hand and <em>tasting</em> it. Perhaps in time, the decision to
    spare the shell of Abigor may not bring so happy an ending.
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Eleanor…”</em>
    It regurgitated the spoken word with glee.
