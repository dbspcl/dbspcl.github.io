<p>
    Alone, witness to the dark, saved only by a flickering lamp, Diana looked
    at the pages in boredom. This book, the stack before it, and the mountain
awaiting afterward had all been penned by one known as    <em>‘Herald the VIII’. </em>She <em>still</em> hadn’t quite grasped who
    that was, and how he was different from the last several Heralds, only able
    to groan out the words, another binge of archaic textbooks and transcripts
    taking a thorough toll. And her reward? <em>Another</em> chapter.
</p>
<p>
    <em>“I’ve just realized something!” </em>
    She recited the text out loud verbatim, hoping to garner <em>some</em>
    level of understanding.
    <em>
        “The Old Arts have not failed me. They’ve <strong>never</strong> failed
        me. For failure is the purpose. The goal! Too often are we concerned
        with the beginning and the end, that we’ve never stopped and considered
        the middle.
    </em>
    …” She finally cut the act, and gave up. “What does that mean!?”
</p>
<p>
    “It means you’re <em>winning.</em> If you’re not enjoying it, you’re doing
    it right.” Eleanor entered her chambers.
</p>
<p>
“So the destination is only worth it if the journey sucks? Is that why    <em>‘Herald the VIII’</em> made this book insufferable to read?”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Exactly!”</em>
    There was a pause, and they both broke out laughing. “Good morning, Sister
    Diana. I brought breakfast. Take a break.” She handed over a bowl of soup
    and, to Diana’s embarrassment, briskly scooped up a nearby miniature wolf
occupying an entire seat despite its small size. “How’s    <em>Mister Wiggles</em> doing? Aren’t you a little old for stuffed
    animals?”
</p>
<p>
    “…I’m not a thousand years old, yet. Remember? Time doesn’t fly for me like
    it does you. I’d like to enjoy my youth while I still can.”
</p>
<p>
    “Are you calling me old? And it’s a little more than a <em>thousand,</em>
    actually.”
</p>
<p>
    “I’ll get there, eventually.” Diana yawned. “Just eight more years. I mean,
    it can’t be as long as the last seventeen, right?”
</p>
<p>
“Here’s hoping. I’m more impressed that you remember the date of the<em>Soulcess. </em>That’s the mark of a good student, and even    <em>better</em> teachers. Heh! And you’re right, that’ll come closer than
    you think. And then, you get a drink of the-”
</p>
<p>
    <strong>“The Forgotten Tears, </strong>
    I know. You’ve all told me, like ten-thousand times.” She yawned again.
    “When’s the new moon?”
</p>
<p>
    From the darkness, past the ornate shelves of this cramped cabin deep
    within the Heart of the Coven, a figure leapt from the ceiling. “Not for
    another half-month. I know you’re tired- but <em>that’ll</em> be solved by
    the Tears, too.”
</p>
<p>
    “Oh! Y-You scared me…”
</p>
<p>
    Eleanor set a hand on Styx’s back. “Any Grimm sightings?”
</p>
<p>
    “No. Well, <em>besides</em> the ones I already stabbed for pleasure. They
never even <em>saw</em> me. Their muted screams were    <em>breathtaking.”</em>
</p>
<p>
    “…I think you’ve been spending a bit too much time with Sister Mania.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you should’ve seen <strong>her!</strong> She’s been edging onto    <em>my</em> territory.” Styx twirled an ornate knife in one hand. “The
    other day, I saw her <em>backstab</em> a Beowolf. So to show her, the next
    Grimm we killed together, instead of the usual, I tramped her style. No
    sneaking to speak of, I just <em>rushed</em> the thing. And when it was
    down, I stomped it repeatedly!”
</p>
<p>
    “Congratulations?”
</p>
<p>
    “It was pretty fun, to be honest. Now I see why Sister Mania prefers such
    brutality over the grace of stealth. That said, I think I’ll just stick to
    the shadows. But don’t worry, I’m not going soft on you-”
</p>
<p>
    “Nobody thought you had.” Eleanor joked.
</p>
<p>
    “-I still hate the Grimm the <em>most.</em> That title stays right here,
    where it belongs.”
</p>
<p>
    Somebody knocked on the door, then entered without any response. Eos had to
slouch just to keep from hitting the doorframe. “I heard the words    <em>‘kill’</em> and <em>‘Grimm’ </em>in the same sentence and came here as
    fast as I could.”
</p>
<p>
    Diana sat up and stretched, her bowl now empty. “…Did everyone just decide
    to invite themselves into my room, or what?”
</p>
<p>
    “Just dropping by to see how you’re all doing. Oh, and to tell you that
    this little birdie had a message for Sister Artemis.” She held forward her
    hand, a bird balanced on her finger. “But since she’s out on a morning
    hunt, the task falls to us.”
</p>
<p>
    “Well?” Eleanor said. “What did the vulture tell you?”
</p>
<p>
    “Sister Mania is in trouble. <em>Don’t panic,</em> it’s not the Grimm. She
    and one other are pinned down in a village many roads from here, under fire
    from a bandit tribe.”
</p>
<p>
    “She’ll be okay, right?” Diana looked away.
</p>
<p>
    “Certainly. The bad pack of humans will fail in their pursuit, as they
    always have. But that malice <em>could</em> bring Grimm, eventually.”
</p>
<p>
    “Who was with her?” Eleanor asked.
</p>
<p>
    Eos paused. <em>“…Abigor.”</em>
</p>
<p>
    “Are you kidding? We’ll have to move fast.” She began a sprint out of the
    Heart of the Coven, only to be abruptly stopped by the bearer of bad news.
</p>
<p>
    “Try not to let your attachment with him cloud your judgment, Sister.
    Whatever happens to his kind, if it doesn’t concern Grimm, is to be met
    with zero action on our part.”
</p>
<p>
    “…I understand.” She resumed her hasty departure while the rest prepared
    together.
</p>
<p>
    “You know she’d save Abigor even if there <em>weren’t</em> Grimm.” Styx
    nudged Eos’ shoulder.
</p>
<p>
    “You’re right. But there <em>might</em> be, and that’s her saving grace.
    And when it’s all said and done, there’s a valuable difference between
    fighting, and <em>negotiating.</em> Eleanor would never harm a human soul.
    At the most, she’d whisk Abigor away to safety, diffusing the conflict. And
    that <em>doesn’t</em> violate our creed.”
</p>
<p>
    “Still, she’s interfering, and she’d do it regardless of the Grimm.”
</p>
<p>
    “I trust her, though. She’s never given me any inclination otherwise, and
    this wouldn’t be the first, or <em>hundredth</em> time she’s put others
    above herself<em>.”</em>
</p>
<p>
    Styx chuckled. “Not that Abigor nor Mania need it. It’s always cute, how
she breaks into a panic whenever the    <strong>‘High Officer of the Seventh Brigade’</strong> <em>might</em> be in
    trouble.” With the way she spoke, it was clear she was mocking the title.
</p>
<p>
    <br/>
    Through the complex, under the vivid gaze of stained-glass windows, all but
    Diana rushed outside. “I-I guess I’ll stay here?” She called out, watching
    them tear past the rippling barrier, entry-shrine, and bridge without a
    response. Not that it mattered. She knew the answer, and with a sigh, she
    returned to her studies.
</p>
<p>
    “Aha! So, this is it, huh?” Troy patted himself on the back, having
    witnessed everything.
</p>
<p>
    “You?” <em>This</em> was enough to make Eleanor pause. “You followed us?
    How long have you been standing in the bushes?”
</p>
<p>
    “Not long, if we’re being honest. Tricks of the trade, as it would seem! I
    set up my store here, and <strong>waited.</strong> Aha. I guess you
expected something grander, huh? I can’t carry this shop on my back, and    <em>believe me,</em> if I could phase it in and out of existence, I would.
    Not everyone’s got magic.”
</p>
<p>
    “Only six of us. Well, <em>seven,</em> if you count Herald.”
</p>
<p>
    “Who?”
</p>
<p>
    Styx finally broke the distance, though she wasn’t alone. “How about you
    introduce <em>yourself,</em> first?”
</p>
<p>
    “Name’s Troy! Always a pleasure to garner new customers. And let me say,
    it’s an honor to meet another patron of that temple over there.”
</p>
<p>
    “What? You saw us leave the Shrine? Then, you must be silenced.”
</p>
<p>
    “B-But I thought I’d be safe from <em>you</em> ladies, of all people!”
</p>
<p>
    “We can’t hurt you.” Styx laughed. “We just have to silence you. Take away
    some memories. We’d need Tormentyst, but… There’s no time. C’mon, we’ll
    have to keep a silver eye on you until we return. Try to keep yourself
    hidden, like me.”
</p>
<p>
    “S-Sure! Another adventure. But first, where are we going?”
</p>
<p>
    “There.” In an indiscriminately unhelpful display, she held forth a finger
    to the fog’s base, past the mountains.
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, then you came to the right place!” Troy said.
</p>
<p>
    Eos interrupted this time. <em>“You</em> came to <em>our</em> house.”
</p>
<p>
    “…Then <em>I</em> came to the right place. Oh, the stories I’ll tell! I’ll
    be famous, as the ferryman for the Coven! Come, quick!” He hopped back onto
    his carriage and prepped the ropes, his horses pattering the ground in
    anticipation. “I can take you where you need to be… <em>For a fee, </em>of
    course.”
</p>
<p>
    “What? You want payment? Lives are at stake.”
</p>
<p>
    “Fine, fine. Last time was on the house. This time, I’ll give you a
    discount. How’s that?” Troy’s resolution brought pause, but Eos was right.
    Their duties surpassed the impulse of greed.
</p>
<p>
    “It’ll have to do. Move quickly.” Eleanor rushed into the cart with the
    others, giving Troy the signal to proceed. Yet, they did <em>not</em> ride
    in silence.
</p>
<p>
    “So, what’s the deal? You seem upset about something. This is just business
    as usual, right?”
</p>
<p>
    “Agreed.” Eleanor spoke for Eos, laying out the details of their newest
    mission in as brisk a matter as possible. “But there’s only one problem.
    These are <em>human</em> enemies. That changes everything.”
</p>
<p>
    “How so?”
</p>
<p>
    “The directive of our master is older than tradition, and the stipulations
    are plentiful- though, they <em>can</em> be summed up with a simple rule.
Deal with Grimm. Witness everything else. You may think it’s enough to    <em>just</em> do our job, but here, going beyond violates law. Though it
    may sadden us to witness humanity destroy themselves, if <em>Grimm</em>
    aren’t the cause, it’s none of our concern.”
</p>
<p>
    “Then why join the fight at all? If you’re not within bounds to play
    referee, watching from the stands could be a breeze.”
</p>
<p>
    “A coven member is <em>still</em> in danger. And the discourse may bring
    something worse.”
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, lovely. So, then, what do you plan to do when we get there?” Troy
    wrangled the reins, making good ground.
</p>
<p>
    Styx, Eos, and Eleanor all looked at each other. “Last time we met, didn’t
    you mention something about fighting <em>yourself?”</em>
</p>
<p>
    “We’re talking bandits? Sure! It might cost extra, though. Just make sure
    you hop off the chariot <em>ahead of time,</em> lest you find yourself an
    accomplice. Wouldn’t want to anger Clotho, right?”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Lady</em>
    Clotho.”
</p>
<p>
    In short order, if things continued in this manner, they’d find their
    destination before the hands of death intervened. But that window was
    closing quickly. Through the volley of arrows, the clanking of swords, and
    the perimeter set by bucklers, those in need of rescue had no choice but to
    ride out the disarray for as long as it took. Mania could thank her lucky
    stars she held powerful friends <em>later. </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>“This is treason. I serve the Coven!”</em>
    She raised a hand, only to quickly lower it and cover her skull mask at the
    sound of arrows, not so much trembling as she was <em>controlling</em>
    herself, back against a barricade of spiked walls. And to her side, the
    equally suited <em>Abigor</em> didn’t fare any better.
</p>
<p>
    “We’ll need reinforcements! If only the<em> Brigade</em> made haste.” His
    confidence flared.
</p>
<p>
    “What do we need <em>them</em> for? Aren’t <em>you</em> the ringleader? Get
    out there and teach the infidels the meaning of hubris. Silver eyes and
    combat expertise aren’t mutually exclusive.”
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, the <em>one-woman army</em> needs a lesson in warfare. Didn’t Eleanor
    ever mention my teachings? For us pesky mortals, relying on ferocity as you
    have isn’t enough. Numbers are <strong>everything.</strong> I’d rather not
    defend a horde thirty-to-one. Not saying I <em>can’t,</em> I’d just prefer
    better odds.”
</p>
<p>
One of the barbarians encircling them threw another threat.    <em>“Give us the silver eyes, and we’ll let the soldier go!”</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>“You aren’t running things.”</em>
    Abigor sighed under his breath. “Okay. I take it you’ll stay here?”
</p>
<p>
    “What do <em>you</em> think?”
</p>
<p>
    Abigor, for the sake of the innocent trapped in the carcass of this mostly
    barren town, left his protection to meet the bandits on the field of
    battle. The encroachers were deceived by his simple equipment and weaponry,
    but learned quickly the victories training and discipline offered over
    brutality alone. The question of whether his skill was fit to finish what
    had only just started couldn’t be determined, now. He was joined by the
    worst of all.
</p>
<p>
    An Ursa shattered through the cobblestone road, injuring enough bandits to
    bring Mania despair then and there. She had to act quickly to save more,
    and so she whisked past Abigor to put herself between the beast, and the
    men who sought her death. He never even saw her <em>move.</em>
</p>
<p>
    Mania was the most ruthless of them all. Every slice from her scythe was
executed as though it would be her last, despite the absence of any    <em>real</em> threat. At least, no <em>visible</em> one. As long as the
    Ursa still hung onto life, it would spread fear among everyone else, and
    bring more. It appeared such a pox couldn’t be prevented.
</p>
<p>
    “That’s enough.” Abigor pulled her away, halting further mutilation of the
    already lifeless Grimm. “The bandit’s cowardice has shown through. One less
    faction to consider. No use torturing what will fade with the clock’s
    ticking. The best move for us <em>now</em> is to-” Another Ursa, reinforced
    with allies this time, arrived from beneath.
</p>
<p>
    Mania began a sprint, but froze at a <strong>whistle.</strong> Behind her,
    Troy’s freight sailed over the gates and impaled each and every fiend.
    “Sisters! About time we got some help!” She cheered. The rest of the
    villagers joined.
</p>
<p>
    Upon a peak in the distance, a watcher studied, diligently hoping for a
    sign of Tormentyst. <em>No such luck.</em> Even so, a good show was hard to
    come by. “Haha! I swear, Kalthus. If Clotho’s slaves weren’t so fun to
    watch, this would’ve been torture.”
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>“It is strictly a business matter.” </em></strong>
    The words rang forth, unmistakably a result of an Oathkeeper, clad in
    bloody rags.
    <strong>
        <em>
            “Do try and stay on task. I know you feel it’s been awhile since I
            issued this assignment, but persistence is a greatly sought after
            skill. If Clotho ever bestowed on her children knowledge of the
            Rhinestone, they’ll slip up. Time is on our side.”
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    “I know, I know. They’re just so fascinating! Who’s your favorite? Is it
    the ditz with fifty pounds of armor? Or, let me guess! It’s that prissy
    miss with the <em>gorgeous</em> sword, who can’t even use it.”
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <em>
            “…Hm. These warriors have served the lands dutifully for many, many
            eras. A small amount of respect is due, Herald the XXI. The gods
            have a hard time forgetting hubris. Forgiveness? That’s a whole
            other matter.”
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    “Aw, c’mon! You gotta admit, they’re entertaining…” Herald was first privy
    to the return of an essentially omnipotent force, just one of a small army,
idly passing through the village. “But it’s about to get a lot    <em>more</em> entertaining. Look at <em>that!”</em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <em>
            “An Eidolon. Though the Coven is pertinent to our cause, their
            death is something I cannot risk. Quick, before we’re seen. They’ll
            need to focus, now.”
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    With Herald’s leave, the celebration ended.
</p>
<p>
    “D-Do you hear that?” Styx turned slowly, dreading she wasn’t alone in
    catching the sound of clops.
</p>
<p>
    “No. I-I mean, yes. But this <em>cannot</em> be. Arm yourselves.” Eos stood
    in front of the rest without hesitation, fully expecting what she received:
    a horse, directed by a blackened corpse. All the townspeople ran screaming.
</p>
<p>
    “A-Again!?” Troy nearly fell backwards. “How many of these things are
    there?”
</p>
<p>
    Short lived was their celebration, in presence of an Eidolon. This was not
    either of the two that had transgressed last time, as made clear by the
    weapon choice: an <em>anchor.</em> This horseman must’ve been responsible
    for that instrument on the fabled ship <em>Falsus Heredis.</em> In regards
    to whether or not it held a higher position, none knew, for now.
</p>
<p>
    “There’s <em>six.</em> Maybe.” Eleanor clarified as it casually approached,
    having spotted them.
</p>
<p>
    “Listen up.” Abigor scooped Troy back to his feet and led him, along with
    the rest of his squad, away. “We can’t be here. Clotho’s Coven performs
    better when we pesky <em>humans</em> aren’t drawing their attention…
    Eleanor? You won’t let me help, will you?”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“As always, you are smart.</em>
    ”
</p>
<p>
    Verbally, Troy resisted the control of Abigor. “I thought they were
    supposed to be rare! Why are they just now plaguing the lands?”
</p>
<p>
    “It’s been awhile since I had to give someone the rundown. Let’s see if my
memory’s still sharp. What you must realize is that they’re old. Oldest    <em>I’ve</em> ever seen, at least. But they’re not regular Grimm. They care
    nothing of human life, neither interested enough to take nor dismiss them.
    The Eidolons <em>long</em> for the death of <em>Descendants.</em> Think
    Silver-Eyed Warriors.”
</p>
<p>
    He flinched, someone having inadvertently chucked a boulder in his
    direction, Mania currently forced to endure the meteoric impact as long as
    she gripped the scythe lodged into the rock. He continued nonetheless. “The
    longer they go without quenching that thirst for blood, the worse they get.
    The years were docile without them, till a few months ago, where I saw one
    myself for the first time. To have <strong>three</strong> attacks in so
    short a time… Until an Eidolon fulfills their purpose, they’ll never stop.
    And even then, they won’t stay dormant for long. So, as you can imagine,
    they bring with them some… <em>Cause for concern. </em>And <em>death.”</em>
    Abigor settled himself in the seat parallel to Troy, at the head of the
    merchant’s wagon.
</p>
<p>
    “Good- <em>Great!</em> I love death.” Troy shuddered. “I didn’t sign up for
    this.”
</p>
<p>
    “You did the moment you met <em>us.”</em> He stopped, spotting one of his
    allies skid across the road into a building. Even if the other members were
    granted similar treatment, he couldn’t let <em>her</em> fate follow.
    “Eleanor! Are you hurt?”
</p>
<p>
    “D-Don’t worry about me! You have to get out of here. You’ve never fought
one of these, because you’re still here. I can’t lose you.    <em>Watch out!” </em>
</p>
<p>
    “There is no lapse in my defense!” He hid behind a bulky shield that cast a
    wide shadow. At worst, it would break but still protect, if it was to
    indeed be used at all. The enemy charged, but fell for a distraction.
</p>
<p>
    “Hey! Yeah, I’m talking to <em>you!”</em> Troy threw stone after stone, to
    little effect. A huge mistake.
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, you’re just asking for it, now.” Eos sighed, taking every incoming
    attack without uttering a sound. No matter what they tried, this Eidolon
    could not be approached. At the slightest movement, a violent reaction
    secured an untouchable dome. The options were clear. Someone needed to
    eliminate the cavalry, or sneak past the perimeter, unannounced. Styx could
    do <em>both.</em>
</p>
<p>
    Through her treachery, the horse’s hooves were sliced at the base. Though
    the Grimm would regenerate, in time, this was serviceable for the moment at
    hand.
</p>
<p>
    Each member circled, vigilant but eager to press this advantage. With its
    back to the sheer brink of a gulley, the Eidolon had no choice but to stay
    and fight. That would have happened either way.
</p>
<p>
    “All this, and for what? It’s not like we’re killing it today.” Abigor kept
    his blade trained,
</p>
<p>
    “You’re right. But we haven’t silenced their spell capable of reflecting
    our eyes. Can anyone think of any way to subdue it? Now would be a good
    time.” She backed away as the foe swung about, its mare caught in a berserk
    tantrum.
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, <em>come on.</em> You think too much. Just brute force the problem.”
    Mania stomped on the ground, recognizing how loose the dusty roadway
    settled. In the glint of orange sunlight, the Black Horseman tumbled out of
    view, lost to a deep, foggy trench.
</p>
<p>
    From the depths, the anchor that so cruelly doubled as a weapon returned,
    clasping onto a nearby lamp post. The fixture was almost torn from its
    foundations, but persisted. Each of the guardians stared, almost afraid to
    touch it.
</p>
<p>
    Troy coughed. “It’s not coming back, right?” In response, Eos left.
</p>
<p>
    “The beast is <em>far</em> below us. This was just the first step of its
    return, but there are many more ahead. For now, we are safe. Evacuate this
    town.”
</p>
<p>
    “We cannot continue like this.” Eleanor sat cross-legged, exhausted.
</p>
<p>
    “We’ll figure something out.” Abigor joined her. “Just like last time. When
    these Grimm grow too agitated, their captain’s hand will be forced. Funny
    to think that instead of controlling them, Aku must <em>appease</em> them.
    Either the Eidolons aren’t worth the trouble to fight, or they’re just too
    strong.”
</p>
<p>
“Waiting as we did then is exactly what allowed Herald the    <strong>XVI</strong> to fall at their hand, though. I… I still miss him.”
</p>
<p>
    “Except this time, we’re prepared. And hey, <em>I’m</em> here now. I’d like
    to see what this so-called Aku is like, and get even just for you. That is,
    if Lady Clotho would allow me to, of course.”
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t be so foolish.” Mania stepped in-between, towering over both of
    them. “Nobody’s ever beaten Aku. Nary has a soul has ever <em>seen</em>
    them. At least, no living soul. A <em>human</em> could never break that
    streak.”
</p>
<p>
    “No. That’s why when the time comes, I’ll need you.” He and Eleanor shared
    a smile.
</p>
<p>
    In silence, another black vulture eyed them all, using the cover of clouds
to keep its existence unknown, this instinct trained acutely by Artemis    <em>just in case.</em> The animal melded with the mingle of clouds. And
    when it retired back in her cellar within the Heart of the Coven, it spied
    how she intently read a pile of bronze sheets inscribed with a message.
</p>
<p>
    “No… <em>No. <strong>No!</strong> Impossible!”</em> Artemis shouted,
    slamming her hands on the desk and leaping to her feet. She had only
    spotted the bird after this outburst, still terrified at the content of the
    tablets.
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        “You… Vulture! Return whence you came! Bring each Coven Member here at
        once! Urgently!”
    </em>
    It paused, then spoke to her. The events of the last few hours were
    discussed with every detail accounted for. <em>“No!”</em> She gasped,
    clinging onto the vulture’s cawed whispers. “They <em>survived?</em> Thank
    the gods.”
</p>
<p>
    “Is something the matter, Sister Artemis?” Diana crept through the doors.
    <br/>
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    “…Yes. While we’ve been here, everyone else waged warfare with another
    Eidolon- <em>but,</em> they survived. That’s not what worries me. We’ve got
    a much, much bigger problem <em>here.” </em>
</p>
<p>
    “How so?”
</p>
<p>
    “It’s… These bronze tablets. I was told it was one of the last means to
    test knowledge of Kingdom Lore. This is intended as the final hurdle of
    research we are meant to undergo. The plan was that in time, you’ll be in
    the same position I’m in now. All of us will. And yet, while there is much
    to learn from these writings, the conclusions are dire… There is nothing
    here to suggest it’s to be saved for the <em>highest members</em> of the
    Coven. Rather, the information held within is wicked.”
</p>
<p>
    “It can’t be that bad. What does it say?”
</p>
<p>
    “It is an ordination of the future. One of us will renounce the will of the
    gods, and betray the Coven.
    <em>
        This person goes by the second name <strong>Xiasma,</strong> when
        alone.
    </em>
    They will forsake everything we stand for, and play a key role in Trajan’s
    return.”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“</em>
    Y-You mean, this is serious?”
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        “Absolutely. <strong>Vulture!</strong> I told you to move! Tell
        everyone to reconvene in the cathedral, now!”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Someone among us is going to betray the cause? Do we know who?
    Everything’s going to be okay, right?” Diana had to run just to keep up
    with Artemis, who scooped the tablets into a burlap satchel and charged
    deeper into the complex. Soon, ornate chandeliers and golden windows were
    replaced with mossy stone that, if barbaric, had at least been carved to
    the edge of perfection. The sound of dripping water persisted through
    everything.
</p>
<p>
    “I will reveal everything in full once we’re all together.” Artemis said.
</p>
<p>
    “But… It can’t be true, right? Maybe it’s a lie, from someone we can’t
    trust. Who wrote the tablets?” Diana gasped at the response.
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Lady Clotho.”</em>
