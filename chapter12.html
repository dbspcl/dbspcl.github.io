    On the deathbed, what was believed to be a corpse laid sprawled out, broken
    but presumably recovering after taking Galathyn’s stab to the chest.
    Nomad’s sacrifice within Summit’s Blight had not been forgotten by any,
    least of which Zara- member of Team Blazer, who had once befriended the
    deer faunus to escape his perilous homeland. He opened his eyes.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“You…” </i>
    He sat up, glaring at her.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re alive! Take it easy!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You… Zara Tir. After all this time, our paths are destined to cross yet
    again.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yep. Many of us were waiting for your reawakening. We were <i>told</i> by
Augustus you would return.” She walked to a nearby closet, and retrieved    <b>Idol’s Cloak.</b> Upon opening the door, it automatically swept over to
    his shoulders. Nomad sat up, looking around, lost. “Oh, and actually, you
    must be mistaken. My name is Zara
    <i>
        Haken.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s… I understand. Where am I?” His voice hadn’t change, still suave if
    cold<i>.</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The morgue!” The way Zara spoke made it seem far more innocent. Many
    gurneys, each holding a story of misery, stretched from wall to wall.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How long has it been since I was poisoned?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No more than a couple days, I think. Maybe more. I wasn’t there, if you
    can remember.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I can. Where is my crossbow?” He tried to stand, struggling before falling
    back onto his stretcher.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
Zara ran up with a plate holding an apple, and a juice carton. “Relax!    <i>Herald</i> took your crossbow the night you were impaled. Here, Augustus
    said you would need food as soon as you came back.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’ll manage without. What is this place, other than the morgue? Where am
    I, really, Zara <i>‘Haken’</i>? And how do I leave?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We’re at <i>Augustus Correctional Facility, </i>on the edge of Vale. Your
    way out is right through that door. But wait! Let me get <b>Team Lance!</b>
    They’ll be excited to see you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No. I have no business in Vale. There is nothing to be gained from waiting
    here. Team Lance will only assist to delay me again.” Nomad found success
    in trying to leave a second time, now properly reacquainted with walking.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What!? But without them, you’d be dead! You’re like one of us now. Our
    friend.” Zara blocked the exit.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s what I’m dreading. Best I depart <i>now</i> rather than later,
    before I’m burdened with leaving even more who see me as one of their own.
    Do not mistaken these actions for a lack of gratefulness, as without
    Beacon’s help, the <i>Grand Gatekeeper</i> would still plague Summit’s
    Blight.
    <i>
        But I’m afraid someone like me doesn’t have much to fear from death.”
    </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “But… What will I tell the rest?” His words drew Zara to the side.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Give them my thanks. Our fates have already been tied together twice. I
    don’t know whether or not I want a third. That sort of uncertainty is my
    burden alone.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Then what is it? Why can’t you tell any of us the truth?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“There is much about me I would not have you know…”</i>
    Nomad paced away, lost in thought. He suddenly looked older, and more
worried. “After all I tried, why is this so difficult? I did    <i>everything</i> possible to make sure Team Lance wouldn’t be pulled into
    this. And yet, we find ourselves here.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Zara looked down. “It’s alright. You can go. But can you tell me this? Are
    you ever going to come back? Is everything going to be okay?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nomad turned around, meaning to address her directly before fleeing the
    prison. “I don’t know. I’m sorry.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He left Augustus Correctional Facility without plans to return. But he had
    little intention to resume his work within Summit’s Blight. First, he had
    to find someone he had failed to consult since before his encounter with
    Zara and Selene in Summit’s Blight, all that time ago. His intuition led
    him past the silver mountains and unending thunderstorms, to a green
    pasture threatening to fall off Sanus, into the sea.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    There was a house, distant on a hill. Prior to it, a bridge- and before
    that, an idol was buried deep into the ground. Using the trees as cover,
Nomad brushed his hand across the monument, upon which the word    <i>“Zenith”</i> was stamped.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Night and day’s war collapsed upon the rickety bridge, creating a lovely
    pink sky. Though nothing but solemn indifference could be detected in
    Nomad’s walk. He budged the large double doors open, and walked into the
    mansion to find a familiar entity on the couch. Now, he found himself in
    the presence of an <b><i>Oathkeeper,</i></b>
    <i>
        clad in bloody rags.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Kalthus.</i>
    I had a feeling I’d find you here. It’s been too long. Why did you lead
    those two girls to me?” He was purely inquisitive in the manner in which he
    conversed.
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    <b>

            “Why, they lost their friends to the Blight.”

    </b>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So it was an act of kinship. Who was guiding the young girl, then? Her
    Aura is remarkably similar to-”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b>
        <i>
            “Zara Haken, she calls herself. She has ties to our cause, even if
            she may not know it. She is eligible to be a Lorekeeper, yes, but
            it’s prudent we leave her out of this, even if we are running on
            borrowed time.”

        </i>
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nomad’s lips curled upwards in a smile. “Funny. Zara would be the perfect
    catalyst for our plans, but you’d not choose <i>her</i> as the sacrifice.
    There’s more humanity in you than I thought.”

            scheduled to begin soon enough. There were many attractions and

            as enemies. But neither of them peak my curiosity quite like the
            Keraseer. To think she still walks the path of a warrior, this is a

    Nomad resumed his rather lonely, and serious attitude with a ruse. “Perhaps
I’ll go ask <i>them,</i> then. Good luck, Kalthus.” He left the    <i>Zenith,</i> as it had now been known, the darkness of night beginning an
    intrusion that wouldn’t relent for another several hours. Yet, he wasn’t
    the only one to resume a journey. The subject of his conversation was
    gearing up to embark on a new one themselves.

    “Do a thumbs up, right?” Nadia demonstrated by following her own commands
    in hopes that Alecto could parrot them.

    “Now, extend your <i>index</i> finger. <i>No,</i> that’s your <i>pinky.</i>
    The index finger. Perfect! Now, do the same with your other hand. You
    should be doing<i> ‘finger guns’ </i>with both hands, like this.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-I think guns might be banned in Augustus Correctional, actually.” Ella
    whispered, looking around to make sure neither her nor her friends could be
    spotted while breaking the rules. But Alecto didn’t care, she was excited
    to see the outcome of Nadia’s trick.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Now, turn your <b>right</b> hand upside down. <i>No,</i> the <b>right</b>
    hand. The one you write with.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Keraseers are ambidextrous, actually.” Alecto let both her hands drop to
    Nadia’s panic.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Stop! Oops, now we have to start all over again.” Nadia’s tone didn’t
    reflect anger, but patience.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well, actually, I can just raise my hands again.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No, you’ve got to complete it in one fell swoop. Otherwise, you’ll lose
    some of the magic. Now, we’ll do it together. Extend your <i>index</i>
    finger. Do the same with your other hand. Now, turn your <i>right</i> hand
    upside down.” Nadia rambled the instructions for the fifth time, while
    Alecto rolled her eyes and performed each command with expert precision.
“Next, put one <i>thumb</i> on the edge of your <i>finger</i>, put one    <i>finger</i> on the edge of your <i>thumb.</i> You should have a box,
    now.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto thought herself successful, but there was one problem. “Well
    actually, it’s a rectangle.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s alright. Now, put the rectangle up to your eyes, and look through
    it.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    They both completed the ritual, each gazing through their makeshift windows
    for a couple seconds until the silence was broke by Alecto. “…I don’t see
    anything different.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Obviously</i>
    not, it’s just a rectangle.” Nadia looked over, still holding her hands up
    to her face. “You’re supposed to use your imagination!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Ugh.”</i>
    Lucifer sighed, bringing two fingers to the side of his head while sitting
    in a nearby chair. “You’re giving me a headache.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hey, it’s not <i>that</i> dumb! I learned it from a good friend back in
    Haven academy. He was only a year older than me back then. Well actually,
    he- he still is.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What was his name?” Selene smiled.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Augustus!” </i>
    Ella gasped at the Warden, who had floated into the room through an
    elevator. “Th-they were making <i>‘finger guns’!</i> I’m sorry, but I had
    to tell him!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Finger guns? What, like <i>this?”</i> Augustus held one bony hand upward
    and pointed at her, causing her to shudder again.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yes!” Nadia walked in between the two. “Now, do the same with your other
    hand! Next, put your finger on the edge of your thumb, like this.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer slammed both hands on the table and hopped up, before demonstrating
    the expression with his digits. <i>“Enough! </i>Just tell him to do this!
    Now, you can see <i>‘fantastic wonders from another world!’ </i>or so I’ve
    been told… Praise be to Atlas, it actually works! There’s a hideous elf in
    front of me!” He stopped and looked directly at Alecto. Without a response,
    she tried to force him to the ground by his neck.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I think we may have a problem.” Augustus muttered over the racket.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What kind of problem? Another assignment?” Nadia asked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Of a sort, perhaps. The Vytal Festival hangs just on the horizon. With it,
    you can expect representatives from all over Remnant to take refuge here in
    Vale, where the tournament fights will be hosted. I’m telling you this
    because that includes Atlas. Even when acting as a guardian during the
    Festival, they’re quite <i>excited</i> to expand the long reach of their
    military. But they aren’t the only Kingdom determined to do so. ”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hmm.” Selene tried to deduce what conclusion he was deriving whilst her
    teammate and captain wrestled with each other on the floor. “There’s
    Mistral, Vacuo, and us: Vale. None of them seem very equipped to stand
    against Atlas.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Look more to the east. <b>Servus Portum’s</b> extent of influence grows
every day. There is another city south of us, right in the line of fire    <i>. </i>Look here.” Augustus eased the need to visualize with a
    holographic map.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Mellow Crest!”</i>
    Selene identified the blip.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Good. You know of it. The Baroness has concerned herself with stifling
    Servus Portum’s expansion, but she’s quite adverse to direct conflict.
    That’s why she needs you. From what I gathered, she isn’t willing to leave
    Mellow Crest, or she isn’t <i>able.</i> A new player has entered the arena
    though, by the name of <b>Victor.</b> The <i>Administrator</i> hungers for
    knowledge. The first step to doing away with Victor is learning his
    secrets, and that’s exactly what I request you get.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Why?” Lucifer lifted himself from the dust.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Three</i>
reasons, actually. <b>First,</b> the Administrator <i>demands</i> it.    <b>Second,</b> <i>Caligula</i> has become a direct threat to both us,
    Mellow Crest, and Mistral. <b>Third,</b> there is a <i>General</i> from
    Atlas who will be overseeing the Vytal Festival, including the tournament.
    It was his adamant concern that Servus Portum stay out of the event, and
    nowhere near Vale. In fact, he’s now on the case of distributed weapons. I
    guess he wasn’t fanatical about a celebration between four unified kingdoms
    being breached by a fifth, foreign one.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I guess if it means preserving the Vytal Festival, it’s a priority.
    Right?” Alecto said.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Sure. Maybe even the dance is at stake, too. I believe you’ve seen it with
    your own eyes. The borders of Servus Portum are forever mobile, constantly
    moving. There are no limits to such an extreme thirst for power.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We can’t let the <i>dance</i> go! We’re one of the one’s planning it!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto scoffed. “Well actually, we’re <i>cleaning up.</i> Big difference.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Grr! But we’re still going, yes? You even spoke to me earlier about who
    you should go with.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer was quick to change subjects. “Wait. A representative from Atlas
    military is coming to Vale? What’s his name?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Uhh…”</i>
    Augustus rifled through a pile of papers positions on a nearby computer.
    “He’s one… <b><i>General Uriel.” </i></b>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer and Selene shared a glance. Though nobody could see anything under
    the soldier’s suit, Selene very obviously held an expression rife with
    glee, and anxiety.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What, you know him?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I know <i>of</i> him. He’s rather well known back in Atlas, actually.”
    Lucifer explained. “But… He wouldn’t want <i>us</i> to go to Servus Portum.
It’s impossible. He must’ve had someone else in mind. At the very least,    <i>you</i> aren’t going. The General wouldn’t allow it.” He pat Selene on
    the back.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hey!” She pouted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A pair of doors opened down the hall, and a new visitor of the mental ward
    entered. With his bandage-riddled garments and innate power of electricity,
    the faunus <i>Terrance</i> couldn’t be missed. Especially not by Ella, who
    froze at his presence. Suddenly in a panic, she sprinted through the
    fastest route out of the facility. Nobody knew the halls better than her
    save for Augustus himself. He regretted allowing that now. When combined
    with an insatiable willingness to push her own friends out of the way,
    subduing Ella was out of the question.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ella, wait!” Nadia ran across the bridge after her, but she wasn’t agile
    enough. In this new rush of alien emotions, her friend had gained some form
    of heightened speed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Where is she going?” Lucifer panted. “Towards the red glow in the
    distance? Oh, outstanding. Now we’re <i>definitely</i> going to Servus
    Portum.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto’s laughing was contagious to the point that Selene began smirking.
    “Alright! Finally, an adversary worthy of my wrath!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Unfortunately, you’re staying here.” He turned to Selene.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Aw, c’mon! Can’t I tag along and help? I’ve never been in Servus Portum,
    before!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “And I would keep it that way. This isn’t a game, and I cannot let you walk
    into destruction. You are not to enter Servus Portum under <i>any</i>
    circumstances. Caligula has already faced me once before. Since then, he’s
    had time only to prepare.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “But I can summon <i>Royal Necrocyst,</i> now! Isn’t that why you had me
    train for so long?” Selene’s voice rose, but she forgot she was speaking to
    the headstrong militant who held a short fuse.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It won’t happen. Sorry.” He was surprisingly calm when striking down her
    ambitions, at least compared to others. She kicked a few stones in anger
    and stomped back across the bridge. Lucifer watched
    for a moment, then turned to Alecto in silence.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…She’ll come around. C’mon.” She corrected his path.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He doesn’t know anything!” Selene barged into the cafeteria. “Can you
    believe he wouldn’t let me go with him!?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Hold up.</i>
    Who did what?” Augustus turned at the first sign of danger, but all he
    found was an aloof princess.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Lucifer! He wouldn’t let me follow him into Servus Portum. I thought we
    were supposed to be a team.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t fuss over it. I’m sure he has only your best interests in mind- he
    always <i>does.</i> But let me just confirm, they <b>did</b> go to Servus
    Portum after all?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Yes. Ella ran in that direction, so we figured it was the best move.”
    Selene explained.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Which brings me back to you, birdy. Identify yourself.” Augustus was
    terrifying when he wanted to be. Perhaps it was the presence of hellish
    smoke where legs were meant to be, the nightmarish physique, or the
    prestigious title of Warden. More likely, it was all three.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-It’s Terrance, sir. I’m from Team Burnt. <i>She</i> knows me!” He looked
    to Selene for confirmation. She nodded.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Then why did Ella run when she saw you? Whatever’s going on here, you were
    the catalyst. She doesn’t remember anything, but she remembered you.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Terrance seemed nervous, but his conviction was convincing. “I have no idea
    who that was. Never seen her before in my life! Why would I have anything
    to do with it, huh?
    <i>
        To think I’m responsible for that ‘Ella’ or her outburst, it’s
laughable! If you accuse me of something again, I’ll        <b>rip off your glasses and…”</b>
    </i>
    He suddenly remembered who was speaking to, and quickly backed up. “Aha!
    I-I mean, I would <i>never</i> do anything to you! Haha! Sorry about that.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Zara stepped into the chamber. “Nomad’s gone.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What?” Selene’s eyes widened.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He left. Walked out of here.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The Administrator won’t be happy. Correct me if I’m wrong, but…” Augustus
    rubbed his cheeks, trying to piece together everything that had happened in
    the last five minutes. “Was it not him who led you and Selene out of
    Summit’s Blight?” Zara nodded. “Then you two have, with Nomad, gone to
    dangerous places before. What’s stopping you from trying again with Servus
    Portum? Just swap the faunus.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Huh? You want me to take Zara and Selene to <i>‘Servus Portum?’ </i>What
    even is that?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’ll see. Follow the red skies, you’ll get there. Don’t forget, you’re
    the reason Ella’s missing.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Zara began warming up to the idea. “So we’re doing this to rescue Ella?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Exactly. Although, if you could gather anything about a man named Victor,
    that’d be much appreciated.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Lucifer’s not going to be happy.” Selene murmured.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He can deal with me, then. And if he does, he’ll answer to the
    Administrator. But that won’t happen.” Augustus led them back to the
    entrance. “You couldn’t be in better hands than with Zara and Terrance.
    Summit’s Blight is proof of that.
    <i>
        Go to Servus Portum, challenge Victor, and come back with everyone
        intact.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If you insist. It can’t be that hard, right? I’ve tackled far worse.” Zara
    lightened the mood. Her allies hadn’t the slightest clue what they were
    walking into, just as oblivious as she was. But their confidence would be
    tested nonetheless.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What do you see?” Nadia inquired.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Take a look for yourself.” Lucifer handed the binoculars to her. The two,
    with Alecto, were standing over a nest or briars, watching the walls of
    Servus Portum. Nadia observed the clones of Aamon guide a shackled Ella
    through the main gates. “There’s more border security this time than
    before, I’m guessing because of us. Slipping through the gears won’t work,
    unless we want a fight on our hands.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How about this. The walls are still moving. We can use nightfall to get in
    close, then hide under something and wait for the walls to literally drive
    over us. Those minions won’t even know we’re there, and then <b>wham!</b>
    The <i>‘wham’</i> refers to us getting inside.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-I get it. What are we hiding under?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We could always use our capes.” Alecto suggested. <i>“…Not it!” </i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Not it!”</i>
    Nadia shouted over her. Lucifer simply stared at the two, either
    disappointed or impressed. Without another word, they used his cloak to
    hide, moving up then waiting for the <i>great</i> nation‘s barricade to
    hover overhead. Of upmost concern was that the colossal wheels missed them.
    They did.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hey! Move over!” Alecto struggled for room under the red cloth.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Enough! Listen… I think we might be inside.” Lucifer shuffled both of them
    towards what he believed to be cover.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    One of the Supreme Leader’s iconic catchphrases boomed thanks to a blimp
    high in the sky. <i>“The iron lung never fails!”</i> Joined by it was a
    bout of cymbals and tubas- a sign of the government’s attempt to boost
    morale.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…<i>Definitely</i> inside.” Lucifer already remembered how much he hated
    the catchphrases and music. But peeking out from their shelter confirmed
    they now resided within the Realm of Caligula. Everyone stood up under the
    cover of an alleyway, and Lucifer strapped his cape back on. The first
    thing he did was advance towards the sound of musical instruments
    clambering for attention.

    Whereas previously, the <i>Choir Battalion</i> substituted multiple
    immobile androids who would play orchestral pieces across the metropolis,
    many things had changed since. Now it simply <i>was</i> a battalion, and
    titled and such. This much became clear once an army of forty or so vocal
    robots marched through the street, playing perfectly in sync. Their
    instruments ranged from horns, to violins, to any variant of percussion.
    Lucifer could see this was hardly uncommon, the same spectacle could be
    found all over Servus Portum.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Avoiding the Choir Battalion at every turn, along with the Servants made to
    enforce twisted law, Team Lance made it to an impasse- what they assumed to
    be some sort of town square. There were a fair few citizens here, all
    wearing rags and terribly emaciated. One of the few clean areas had been
    marked with a massive bronze statue of somebody purely unknown, and the
    final signifier that things had changed were the intolerable holographic
    screens.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    They were <i>everywhere.</i> Strapped to almost every building and above
every broken road, they cluttered the view. Each projected    <i>The Godwin Program-</i> An eccentric man sharing the name of his show
    preaching in front of a camera, speaking on the optimal law of acting,
    talking, and thinking. Coupled with this were reminders of how free the
    empire really was. But it seemed old habits died hard, as the propaganda
    everywhere remained unchanged.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Being a Servant is the highest honor!” The aircrafts proclaimed again.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah, yeah, I get the point.” Nadia whispered. “Let’s get across, quick.
    B-But keep an eye out for Ella.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Wait! Look.” Lucifer dragged her back behind the decrepit shop being
    utilized as a shield. He pointed at the statue, which depicted a man with a
    medal-marred coat and militaristic hat. But to demonstrate his point
    better, he had her look through the binoculars, which were trained on the
    effigy’s left
    <i>
        eye.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “A camera?” Nadia made sure she was seeing right. Then, to everyone’s
    shock, the statue moved. Looking left and right, it seemed this sculpture
    acted as another avenue for surveillance, likely to drop a squad of
    Purifiers at the slightest hint of treachery.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What do we do?” Alecto looked to her leader, who seemed far more equipped
    for bypassing technological diversions. But when it came to stealth, there
    was an undisputed queen.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nadia. Turn invisible, and get across on your own. As for us, pay
    attention now. See?” Every several batch of seconds, the humanoid memorial
    would stop watching, and salute a passing blimp along with every other
    obedient civilian. <i>That</i> was their chance to cross the passage.
    Executing the plan perfectly, while also avoiding Purifiers and the Choir
    Battalion, brought the three heroes to a new structure entitled the
    <i>
        Sermon Emporium.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The interior was extravagant, certainly more well cared for than most of
    the buildings present. Parade lights and immaculate decorations covered
    every inch of what seemed to be a souvenir shop. But in practice, it was
    more of a museum. And in the middle, another carved statue that mirrored
    the same design as the one at the municipality’s center. This gallery
    wasn’t made in tribute to Caligula, but rather the plaques and decorations
    serviced one
    <i>
        Joseph Victor.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Joseph Victor?” Nadia identified their target, browsing through a display
    of flags and posters in honor of him.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“That’s <b>General</b> Victor!”</i>
    The mannequin in the middle of the shop, which had been idly singing a tune
    of warfare and glory, turned and shouted at Nadia. She quickly repeated his
    words, remembering a similar scenario earlier in the semester. The machine
    went back to its chanting.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If their goal was to gather information about Victor, Lucifer considered
    reading the main pedestal’s writings a good start. He skimmed it, but
    blurted out loud the important sections. “So <i>General</i> Victor recently
came to power in the last month or so, but since then he’s done    <i>‘great’ </i>work for the country. He’s not as powerful as Caligula, but
    apparently it was <i>him</i> who ushered in all the video propaganda seen
    across the city.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I guess he’s pretty tech-savvy, then?” Alecto deduced.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You could say that. According to this, he was the one who <i>made</i>
    General <b>Aamon</b> in the first place. That is, all the clones you see
    prowling the streets. Supposedly, there is one original Aamon, built by
    Victor. But using secrets of dust and Aura, he’s managed to duplicate his
    fellow comrade to produce an <i>infinite</i> army. <i>Golly.</i> I’d
    imagine he’s also responsible for the <i>Choir Battalion,</i> and every
    living statue we’ve seen.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nadia shook her head. “Wow. No wonder they gave him his own exhibit.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It appears that he’s to thank, or rather blame, for a number of other
    technological advances. He’s proven invaluable in Servus Portum
    engineering. Which is bad for us.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto occupied herself with the merchandise too expensive for anyone to
    actually purchase. “Look at all this stuff… Flags, toy guns, books, and
enough memorabilia to cover an island.    <i>‘The ideal man fears nothing.’”</i> She read off some of the artwork.
    “It’s sort of cool, even if it is somewhat macabre. So he hasn’t warmed up
    to the White Fang, has he?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Of course not. Nobody here has.” Lucifer growled over that fact that at
    one point, he stood among them on this issue. “Such arrogance would lead
    them down a path of destruction, for as much as I hate to admit it, the
    White Fang has its uses. The <i>fools</i> could never comprehend that.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“You are a detractor!”</i>
    The statue of Victor walked off its shrine and approached him.
    Instinctively, Lucifer began taking aim with his gun, but Nadia stopped
    him.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Remember last time? Let’s not repeat that. C’mon, we can probably outrun
    him!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    He paused, but eventually nodded. All three retreated. But chase was given
    quickly, and now quite a commotion was <i>in</i> motion. It wasn’t long
    until Purifiers, <i>Aamon’s</i> spawn, joined the fray. Tearing through
    assorted walkways brought them face to face with another marching band. The
    group of musicians didn’t split, they walked with confidence forward only
    to be thrown aside first by the transgressors, then their own men. And at
    the back of this havoc-inducing parade, the metal Victor stomped after
    them, crushing anyone and anything idiotic enough not to move aside.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer spared himself and Alecto by turning the corner, and entering a
    warehouse. The Purifiers and their motorized boss darted past the door. The
    entire time, Nadia decided she didn’t want to be seen. So she <i>wasn’t</i>
    seen. “What is this place?” She appeared beside her friends inside a
    corridor. Poor transients who were likely swallowed whole, along with their
    towns, had a habit of coming to this location first.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The walls were lined with feats of automation- robots similar to Aamon, but
    serving a different purpose. They would record new locals, who were likely
    unwillingly kept here. Inside the walls of this custom house, <i>people</i>
    were object of importation, and documentation of one’s arrival was
    required.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer, Nadia, and Alecto paced through the facility towards the exit. But
    the front door was out of the question thanks to the watchful sentries.
    Rather, they ascended to the upper levels and left just to find a metal
    bridge high in the sky, surrounded by the resident pollution. Enduring the
    orange smoke brought them even higher, straight to a dead end.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What now, genius?” Alecto tiptoed to the edge, looking down to confirm how
    high they were.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If we jump, we can use our landing strategies. What’s yours, Nadia? Don’t
    think I’ve ever seen it.” Lucifer inquired.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You wouldn’t have. I use my semblance, and spread my cape to catch wind.
    It slows me down so I can use <i>gymnastics</i> to finish the job. A friend
    in Mistral taught me. But to use my aerial technique here, I’ll have to
    stretch a bit.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You do that. I could catch a breath myself, actually.” Alecto tightened
    her wrist guards and lifted her helm, desperately hoping she could find a
    pocket of breathable air.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Seek refuge in servitude to the state!” Caligula’s voice boomed. They were
    far higher now, so the blimps’ streams of jingles and slogans were loud
    enough to vibrate their footholds.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Ugh. Please, shut <b>up.</b></i>
    How many times must I endure your relentless babbling?” Lucifer barked. But
    this time, the loudspeaker’s voice responded. It was at that moment that
    they realized that this wasn’t the preset speeches from above, but rather
    the real deal.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Not much longer, now.”</i>
    <b>Caligula</b>
    trudged through his smog and cornered them at the brink of the upraised
    platform. “Your time in Remnant has expired. But your service to the
    greatest Kingdom within it, <i>Servus Portum,</i> has just begun. For there
    will <i>never</i> be peace and order until all succumb to the same fate.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, I’m <i>sure.”</i> Lucifer was jumping at the chance to finally share
    some choice words with the Champion Autocrat. “Engulfing <i>every</i>
    passing civilization unfortunate to stand in your scorched trail and
    subject them, as well as your own <i>people,</i> to torture and
brainwashing. Very <i>peaceful and orderly,</i> you complete <i>nitwit.</i>    <i>God,</i> I wish I was stupid enough to believe the kind of gibberish
    clouding your head. Must be entertaining.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Stupidity?</i>
    <b>No,</b>
    in fact, the chance to <i>protect</i> Remnant and turn it into something
greater is what keeps me going. <i>Freedom!</i> It is the fire within, the <i>drive</i> that will push me to finally cure the scourge that is Atlas:    <i>you!</i> And I will show <i>everyone</i> equal mercy under this reign!
    Even now, the Infection gains. I have given the Servants the greatest
    honor: a sacrifice for their Kingdom!
    <i>
        Serve us, Serve
        <b>
            Many!”
            <p>
            </p>
        </b>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer interrupted the appeal by blasting Caligula in the head with a
    shotgun. “How many times do I have to kill you, old man!?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Much like the last time Lucifer managed to fire upon him, Caligula was
    blown backwards and his Aura exploded into nothingness. But Caligula
    crawled to his feet. <i>Unscathed.</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, <i>Lucifer.</i> That’s <i>cute.</i> But it won’t do you any good!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How do you know my name?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It was you who told me, remember?” Caligula presented a used bullet, which
    was immediately identified at the round Lucifer shot at him <i>last</i>
    time. “This little gem is from Atlas, same as you. In fact, everyone knows
    your name up there. Everyone remembers you. Everyone <i>worships</i> you.
    It’s almost enviable, quite frankly.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Lucifer, what’s he talking about?” Nadia questioned him.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Are you well known in Atlas?” Alecto added.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “N-No! I’m nobody that matters! I’m from nowhere.” He was expedient in his
    wording, and it may have been enough if there wasn’t an enemy playing the
    other angle. The warlord did his homework.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “And I thought <i>myself</i> a master of deception. Go on, Lucifer. Tell
    them who you <b>really</b> are, and why you’re <i>actually</i> here. You’ve
    no interest in being a Huntsman, do you?” Caligula contributed greatly to
    the seed of doubt planting in Alecto’s mind all those nights ago by a
    masked zealot, the Last Duke.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What is it? Is there something you know that we don’t?” She stepped
    towards Lucifer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “N-No! This idiot is <i>lying!</i> He knows
    <i>
        nothing!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Caligula wouldn’t take that insult without stoking the fires. Were it
anyone else, they’d have been executed by now, but he found the struggle    <i>exhilarating. </i>“I know plenty, Virtus. Ever since you made an attempt
on my life, I’ve learned quite a bit about you, and your friends. Miss    <i>Keraseer.</i> Miss <i>Flora.”</i> He bowed, clearly intending to mock
    them.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Y-You know <i>our</i> names, too?” Nadia exhaled, suddenly increasingly
    paranoid.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Aha! He <b>is</b> smart! What are you hiding, Lucifer!” Alecto didn’t seem
    to care about Caligula’s infractions towards her yet. Being identified
    as a Keraseer seemed to be a common occurrence. And this fact was one
    Lucifer used to deflect her line of questioning.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How about you, huh? Every <i>king, mastermind,</i> and <i>criminal</i>
    we’ve come across has identified you by that armor alone! What’s the secret
    behind it!?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Guys, enough!” Nadia warped between them, failing to keep the peace.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “A house divided! How trivial.” Caligula laughed loud enough for them to
hear. Behind him, metal footsteps indicated an intervention. The    <i>True</i> Aamon joined his Supreme Leader on the bridge, surrounded by
the fog of clean industry. “Oh boy, <i>General!</i> I am having a    <i>really</i> good day, today. Tell me something to make it <i>even</i>
    better.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’ve received word from General <i>Victor.</i> He’s found
    <b>
        her.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Oh, yes!”</i>
    Caligula moaned, turning back to Team Lance. They stopped bickering and
readied their arms at seeing him approach. “Haha, you don’t want to do    <i>that!</i> Because if you kill <b>me,</b> you will never find that
    precious Miss <i>Selene</i> ever again!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>“What!?”</i></b>
    Lucifer nearly pushed his allies off the bridge and charged Caligula.
    <i>
        “If you lay a finger on her, I will squash your pathetic city like a
        bug, and there will be nothing left but ashes when I am finished with
        you!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>Host</i>
    Aamon retreated, apparently unfit for a battle of this competence. In his
    place, he sent reproductions of himself. So it fell to Nadia and Alecto to
    fend them off, while Lucifer attempted to strangle his new nemesis.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Having a full stash of Aura certainly helped but Caligula was far taller,
    and surprisingly strong considering the age his appearance suggested.
    Eventually, at the cost of some petulant punches, Caligula was able to
    shove Lucifer off him and gain access to his personal arsenal.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Under the confines of his coat, Caligula held every explosive and variation
    of firearm known to man. Nadia could have sworn she peeked a fair few axes
    and swords as well, in the short survey taken whilst sneaking up from the
    rear.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Argh!”</i>
    Caligula tensed as four needles began pumping into his back. She couldn’t
    believe he had the wits to still be moving, let alone <i>fighting.</i>
    Reaching around, he ripped her off and swung her by the neck, eager to drop
    the covert out of the fight. And at Alecto’s approach, he whipped out a
    mini-gun and mowed down any potential advance.
    <i>
        “Won’t you children <b>ever</b> understand? My blood runs cold as
        Grimm, and my heart dead as stone! Throw <b>anything</b> you’ve got at
        me! Stab me, shoot me, crush me, I’ll <b>always</b> return! Give in,
        now, and I will permit you a quick execution!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>

<p>
    “Then I’ll keep coming <i>back!”</i> Lucifer waited for Nadia to squirm
    back over solid ground, then sniped Caligula in the hand, completely
    eviscerating the muscle required to lift anything at all. Nadia was
    released. Then, Alecto speared him through the chest with her blade.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What did I <i>just</i> tell you? A monologue is hard when nobody wants to
    listen.” Caligula pulled the elongated dagger out of himself, bleeding
    <b>
        black.
        <p>
        </p>
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No!” Alecto stumbled to the edge to see the sheen of her short sword
    disappear under the red clouds. Her other golden broadsword was back at
    Beacon, in her locker. She was joined by her teammates, who retreated at
    the sight of an army. Aamon’s Purifiers arrived to back up a somehow still
    readily kicking Caligula. “I can’t afford to lose my blade. I’ll meet up
    with you two later, I promise.” Alecto willingly plunged off the edge,
    beneath of a hellish haze.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…No. We’ll meet up with her <i>now.”</i> Lucifer held his hand out to
    Nadia, and both followed Alecto to a calamitous cascade downward.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Caligula beamed at the withdrawal, but still had an urge to do away with
    the pests while he still could. “You morons! <i>Shoot</i> them!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Purifiers obeyed, but it was too late. No one from Beacon succeeded in
    executing Caligula, but that was never the real mission. Now, all they
    longed for was the space to enact their landing strategies. And more than
    anything, in addition to upholding his own safety, Lucifer wanted to ensure
    Selene’s. But while the bulk of Team Lance had their hands full with the
    mad tyrant, from the moment they had left, their friends found themselves
    tangled in a web crafted by the imperialist’s abettors.

<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I already told you, I don’t know who Ella is, was, or why she ran away
    from me. I’d never seen her before in my life. Maybe she’s confused.”
    Terrance explained.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“I’m</i>
    confused. Nothing about this is right.” Zara lead the way, dodging around
    corners and thin roads less travelled. “If you don’t know why Ella ran when
    she saw you, then we have to find her, and learn the truth. I just wish you
    could give me something. At this point, the search might take all night.
What we <i>really</i> need to do is find the robot that took her. He    <i>must</i> know something.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What makes you say that?” Selene wondered.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Remember how we entered? We were spotted while trying to get in close,
    right when we saw Ella get escorted through the gates. But the henchmen
    decided to leave their post as soon as they noticed us.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Huh. I assumed they were just set to walk around regardless. In Atlas, the
    protocol for sentries aren’t much different. Of course, they were early
    prototypes.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Exactly. There’s no way they missed us. What is it about <i>her</i> that
    intrigued him, and <i>us</i> that made him disregard his duties? Ah!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I will tell you personally.” An accomplice of the type discussed ambushed
    them from behind. “Wait.” He held a hand forward, genuine in his want for
    them to halt.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Too surprised to listen, Zara threw one of her hooks forward, slicing his
    calves clean off.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t shoot. I represent Aamon <i>‘AA0001.’</i> I won’t fight you, Zara
    Tir.” The apprentice tried again, only to be cut off by another swinging
    blade. This time, his neck was the point of collision.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That <i>isn’t</i> my name.” Zara scowled, walking over to the decapitated
    head.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Do you think we’re out of the woods?” Terrance began punting the noggin
    around. He stopped, partly from shock, when it began vocalizing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “More will come. They will not kill you though. We are fascinated with
        you. Aamon ‘AA0001’ wants to talk.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Zara mocked him with her sneering. “Really? You’re a friend? You expect us
    to believe that?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Why else wouldn’t I make any attempt to fight you?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He’s got a point.” Selene pointed forward. “He didn’t even try to move out
    of the way of those hooks!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Zara bounced the idea in her head for a moment, then asked the Aamon double
    directly. “Why didn’t you block such a lame attack?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “That attack, those hooks, simple and familiar as they are, were
        unknown to me in a combat scenario. But it is known to me now, and we
        learn from our mistakes. Aamon <b>‘DE2947’</b> has fallen, but another
        will rise again. And he will know such of the tactics that killed his
        brethren.”
    </i>
    He powered down, only able to communicate for so long after being beheaded.
    <i>
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So… The next clone won’t be beat so easily? How does that work?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“If that was number <i>‘D-Whatever,’ </i>does that make Aamon<i>‘AA0001’</i> the leader? I think he mentioned that before you    <i>mutilated</i> him.” Terrance threw around some theories. “Maybe the
    first Aamon can communicate between them, like a hive-mind. But without
    cracking this guy open and finding an expert, there’s no use guessing. I’d
    have to get Boreas to look into it. I wonder if he knows anything about
    computers.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Lucifer knows all about them! I bet if he and Boreas work together, we can
    solve Caligula’s secrets!” Selene added. As the two discussed the
    hypotheticals behind Aamon’s strange behavior, Zara decided to take a
    glance into the city to find Ella. But what she saw brought immense
    hardship to her, and soon to her cohorts.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Near the outskirts of Servus Portum, a herd of faunus were being led with
    chains by another Purifier. It could be assumed they once stood against the
    regime as ideologues of the <i>White Fang.</i> In order to better complete
    the labor forced upon them, each had two barbed sickles bound onto their
    bodies with dust. The tools held an unmistakable resemblance to Zara’s own
    set of hooks.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What is it? Have you found anything?” Selene followed Zara’s eyes to the
    obscene sight. It took her slightly longer to put together the pieces after
    looking back and forth a few times. “Z-Zara, wait!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Without even offering the dignity of a response, Zara turned around and
    ran. Once again, Selene was the least agile of anyone from Beacon Academy,
    and was unable to even begin running after her. <i>Terrance</i> probably
    could have done something about it, if he hadn’t taken the chance to
    disappear himself. “Zara, stop! <i>Wait!”</i> Selene tried again, before
    realizing she was completely alone.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Zara!... Aha, guys? This isn’t funny! Terrance! Where are you?” She called
    out. Realizing the amount of noise she was producing, both hands covered
    her mouth. She could do nothing but shakily control her breathing as first
    a band of Purifiers passed by, then an <i>actual</i> band courtesy of the
    Choir Battalion.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    In somewhat a panic, she remembered her last line of defense was still
    available, and it would remain that way until her Aura depleted. Royal
    Necrocyst was now a frontrunner in keeping her safe, rather than the
    intended last resort she trained it as.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“You can do this… It’s why you went to Beacon.”</i>
    She breathed in and out, then began prowling the puddle-ridden avenues
    littered with broken streetlamps, hoping to find <i>anyone.</i> The clamber
    of Servus Portum’s orchestral team kept her away from the busy mainland.
    Enemies were never far, though, as even here the prestigious and eminent
    Victor was within earshot.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Prime Solomon.”</i>
    His voice was far more terrifying than Caligula’s. Following it, Selene
    managed to peek from behind a dumpster down a tunnel, to see the
    distinguished man speak to this <b>Prime Solomon</b> person.
    <i>
        “I thought it prudent to inform you, a round of detractors have arisen
in the confines of our city, and from what I’ve gathered this is the        <b>second</b> time they’ve trespassed on the Land of Servants.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, yes, I do recall.” Prime shook his head. The man was wearing what
    Selene interpreted as <i>religious robes, </i>implying a strong sense of
    esteem. “Don’t forget that the first time they wronged
     Supreme Leader Caligula, you were not even yet in power. You know
not what you’re up against this time, General Victor. Lucifer waged a    <i>war</i> with Caligula in these walls, and he managed to walk away.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He did?” Selene carefully processed each word.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Better yet,” Victor continued. “There is word of a faunus prowling our
    midst, with horns and the mark of the inferior. Fortunately, tonight is
    going to be a <i>good</i> night for a hunt. She is bonded with the shackles
    of servitude. Keep <i>one</i> eye out at <i>all</i> times.” He leaned
    forward and pointed at his <b>left</b> eye.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-If it is Caligula’s will, then I must abide. Serve us, serve many.”
    Prime agreed, and began fiddling his way further into the tunnel. Seeing
    that Victor was approaching, Selene turned to quietly scamper out of his
    chosen trail. But contrary to reality, she ran <i>directly</i> into him
    before one step could be made.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Who are you?”</i>
    He locked his hand around her wrist.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-I’m just a citizen! Servus us, serve many! See?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Victor paused, the pupil of his eye turning blindingly bright. Ardent mist
    faded away from his evil peeper, and with that, he could somehow detect
    truths and lies. It would have been a wonderful gift in the hands of
    another.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Deception of a Servus Official in punishable by <i>death!</i> Who are you <i>really?</i> A dress of this sort is outlawed here- you look    <b>ridiculous!</b> What business could a... <i>Princess? Ahahaha!</i> Oh!”
    He bowed, still holding her arm. “My mistake! I didn’t realize I was in the
presence of the one and only <i>Atlesian Empress.</i> Please,    <i>‘haveth’</i> mercy upon<i> ‘thee!’ </i>Haha! Always a pleasure, but
    we’re not in <i>Atlas</i> anymore, little damsel.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I-I don’t know what you mean! I’m serious! Let me go, <i>now!”</i>
    Selene’s had her <i>own</i> tricks. Her eyes turned glossy black in
    preparation for her semblance.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
Victor payed no attention, tapping an earpiece. “Aamon. Tell    <i>Supreme Leader Caligula</i> I’ve just got ahold of the North’s finest
    treasure… We’re going to go see <i>him</i> now, okay? You will be an
    invaluable resource in purifying the horizons up north.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Out of nowhere, he was jumped and thrown away. But it wasn’t Selene
    responsible <i>nor</i> Royal Necrocyst. Rather, it was <i>Zara </i>and her
    natural repurpose of hooks as a weapon.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Who in the- <i>You!? ”</i> Victor stood up to see his aggressor. “It’s
    brave of you to come back, even if you are a child of the Impure Menace.
    Not once has a faunus who has slithered out of my infinite and unending
    sight has so willingly returned. I’m touched, but it’s time. The cage
    awaits.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Selene, get up!” Zara ignored him, holding her hand out. “We need to get
    out of here. It’s not safe.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Of course. But, where did you go? Why did you run?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’ll explain everything once we’re out of this, okay?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Victor tried to help out. “The little lamb had lost her way. She tried to
    forget all about the past, and where she came from. As it turns out, she
    may have succeeded. But she was foolish enough to come <i>back,</i>
    and remember who she is. Who she <i>really</i> is. Am I right?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Zara refuted his diagnoses, but with another abuse of the Evil Eye, he knew
    its legitimacy. “Aha! The truth <b>is</b> the truth. You can <i>run</i>
    from it. You can <i>hide</i> it. But <i>like</i> the truth, you can’t evade
    <b>
        me.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’ve had a <i>really</i> bad day.” She clenched her teeth, her lashes
    flaring flames, illuminating the streets. “So if you don’t let us go,
    <i>
        I won’t evade you. I’ll <b>kill</b> you.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A smile crept across Victor’s lips, and he was off. To become Caligula’s
    trusted right hand man was a task that required fighting experience. And as
    evident from Victor’s staggering expertise in hand-to-hand combat, there
wasn’t much to improve upon. Even more concerning was his    <b>teleportation.</b> The students had already deemed his ability to see
    through falsehoods his semblance. But if <i>that</i> was true, then there
    was no explanation for how he zipped around, flashing from one spot to the
    next in the time it took for Zara to blink.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Two</i>
    fighters? Why that’s no good!” He somehow got in between the two, pushing
    them apart. “Have to try it the old way, like me! You have no allies here!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“For anyone else, that might be true.”</i>
    Zara remembered the words of Nomad, and used them for a confidence boost
    necessary to clip her assailant several times with swings sharp in both
    calculation and the literal sense.
    <i>
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Victor had seen the hooks before, on his own victims. Transgressions were
    rare, but he was experienced enough to know what to do. He let one swoop by
    him, wrapping the cords around his arm to tether her in place. With
    effortless pulls, Zara was within his reach. He throttled her by the neck,
    gloating.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’re not a hero, so stop <i>acting</i> like one! You’re a <i>lost</i>
    rebel with a <i>fake</i> uprising! Get back in line!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Let her go!” Selene shouted from behind. Victor was tugged away by Royal
    Necrocyst, losing his iron grasp on Zara. The skeleton hand surpassed him
    in height, contributing greatly to its fear-factor. Suddenly, Victor found
    himself battling an undead arm conjured from a mystic gateway, all the
    while Selene ran over to check Zara’s health.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Are you alright? He didn’t hurt you, did he?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “N-No. I’m fine.” Zara coughed out.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Perfect. Quick, let’s run for it, while he’s occupied!” She pulled the
    faunus up but let her take the lead. Zara was naturally faster, and didn’t
    have to deal with formal clothes. <i>“Keep him busy.”</i> Selene whispered.
    It was an omen that guaranteed Royal Necrocyst would engage with Victor for
    as long as possible, before departing back into the horrific dimension.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Here, let me carry you. We’ll cover more ground that way.” Zara scooped
    Selene into her arms. “I’m sorry for leaving. This is all my fault.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I get it, okay? I’m not mad at you. I’d probably do the same if I realized
    that I was… you know?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “A <i>slave?”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Th-That’s not what I meant-”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“It’s alright. That was many, <i>many</i> years ago. I wish it had    <i>stayed</i> forgotten, frankly.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “So like that big meanie said, you didn’t remember Servus Portum?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Zara shook her head. “No. I have a confession to make. All this time, I’d
    never truly remembered where I’d come from. My early years were always a
    blur. And before you ask, no, I don’t know <i>why</i>. But when it’s just a
    fact for most of your life that you have no idea where the first couple
    years of your childhood went, you don’t question it. You just move on.
    Guess that’s not an option anymore, is it?” She switched topics, suddenly
    feeling sick at the thought of the conundrum. “Is Royal still fighting?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“…” Selene focused hard to gather the details of her semblance summon.    <i>“Yes! </i>But he can’t last much longer. That Victor guy must be really
    powerful.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Then let’s move. We need every second we can get.” They both acknowledge
    how late it was. Hopefully Lucifer, Alecto, and Nadia had already succeeded
in locating Ella. Everyone had escaped their pursuer, but were still being    <i>hunted.</i> There was one exception though- <i>Terrance.</i> All this
    time, he’d used Zara’s breakdown to isolate himself, and prey upon Ella
    without any meddling spectators.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Where <i>are</i> you?” Terrance rumbled. Beating himself up over his
    inability to find her didn’t help, but it at least made him feel as though
    his efforts weren’t <i>completely</i> in vain. “How did you get away from
    me
    <i>
        again?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Wandering past machines ravenous for a drop of blood, and taking cover with
    every march of a chorus, slow progress was a given. He was a <i>faunus,</i>
    looking for another <i>faunus</i> in <i>Servus Portum.</i> There couldn’t
    be a more undesirable sport to participate in. But in spite of his constant
insistence otherwise, Terrance knew what he was doing. He was    <i>determined</i> to recover Ella, and for him it was well worth the risk.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, Ella was <i>gone.</i> Not a soul in Remnant could locate her.
Though Terrance <i>did</i> discover something far rarer, not to mention for    <i>him,</i> horrid. Entering an empty dome which served a purpose at one
    point in time regarding combat, he came across an
    <i>
        Oathkeeper clad in bloody rags.

    Terrance, in a childish tantrum considering he had an <i>electricity-</i>

    existence.

<p>
    Terrance watched his converser retreat into a portal, waves of blue energy
    whisking the curator of his immeasurable hatred away. And as this
    fantastical channel faded into nothingness, <i>Ella</i> emerged in its
    wake.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Y-You?” She sputtered, backing away.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He had you in Idol’s Twilight? Wait! Don’t run!” Terrance slowly advanced.
    “Don’t you remember me? Anything? You can’t tell me he ruined <i>that,</i>
    too?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “A-All I remember is how much of a <i>monster</i> you were!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He really did it…” Terrance’s expression dropped, sadness seeping into
    every thought, every fabric of his being. Without warning, the heartache
    morphed into a sinister dose of fury- and Terrance would have acted on
    these raw emotions if the spoken premonitions in regards to bystanders
    hadn’t come to pass.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ella!?” Lucifer descended upon the two from one of the rotten abattoirs
    substituting for entrances. “Praise be to Atlas, we’ve finally found you.”
    Before he could lay a hand on her back to usher the young faunus with a
    mechanized tint away, Nadia beat him to it.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh! Thank the gods you’re alright!” She was identified first by her voice,
    then her physical form arising from empty space. The two Descendants clung
    onto each other. “You’re safe. Where have you been all this time? Have you
    any idea what we’ve been through to find you?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alecto rolled her eyes. “Sounds like it wasn’t very fun to be led around
    Remnant without a clue to find an Amaryllis who went rogue for no reason.
    Sure sucks, doesn’t it?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hey! <i>Not</i> funny!” Nadia huffed out, crossing her arms. “But
    seriously, Ella? Why did you run?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Ella stammered to say anything, looking at Terrance. He was <i>also</i>
    told to keep the last few minutes a secret. Nadia was perceptive enough to
    spot the exchange. “You ran because of him, didn’t you? I knew it! What did
    you do to her?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “N-No! Like I said, I have no idea who she is! I just found her wandering
    around this cage by herself! You’re <i>welcome,</i> by the way. It was just
    the two of us. <b>Nobody else,</b> I swear.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Shhh! <i>Listen!”</i> Lucifer hissed, everyone freezing. Across the sandy
    battle ring, through the main entrance, the silhouettes of two approaching
    contenders could be seen. Everyone hid, with the ringleader Lucifer waiting
    to subdue the meddlers.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We should’ve left when we had the chance. That quadrant we just passed was
    free of baddies!” Selene contested. “More than likely, the rest already
    escaped! If we don’t leave quickly, Lucifer’s going to find out I snuck in
    here!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Zara used an orange lantern, which at one point was attached to a rickety
    post, to illuminate the way. “Don’t be dramatic. Even though Royal needs
    some rest, I think Victor’s long gone. He has no idea where we are. I
    thought you wanted to come here anyway, silly. Believe me, I really wish we
    hadn’t. No use complaining now.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hya!” Lucifer locked Zara in a chokehold, ready to crush her if need be.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Gah! What are you doing? Get off me!” Zara’s shouts were too muffled to
    hear. It wasn’t needed. Lucifer identified his mistake, not at all
    expecting the goat faunus to be snooping around in a place like this. More
    concerning, however, was <i>Selene’s</i> involvement in the situation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ah! Lucifer?” She nearly fell back, receiving his tight embrace. It wasn’t
    rare for Lucifer to show such vulnerability whenever he assumed <i>she</i>
    stood on the brink of peril.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Why did you come here? Why did you disobey my orders?” He retracted his
    metal goggles to further his own conviction. Though he now lost the
    sinister shock complementary to the computerized mask, there was a special
    sting in his <i>real</i> voice.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s fine! We’re oh-<i>kay!</i> I told you I was prepared, see? We fought
    some robots, and then I used Royal Necrocyst to get away from Victor!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Ugh. I go through hell and back, and somehow you <i>fight Victor,</i> and walk away without consequence. <b>How?</b> Do you
    think it’s a girl thing?” He looked at Alecto. <i>She</i> tried
    back-handing him.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“That’s <i>Lucifer, Alecto, Nadia, Selene, Terrance, Ella,</i> and    <i>myself</i>…” Zara confirmed that everyone was at long last together
    again. “Guys? Guys! We’re all safe, and the mission’s complete. We’ve
    learned a lot about Servus Portum. In my case, far too much. None of that
    matters now! I know how to get out of here!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Selene backed her up. “Oh, that’s right! There was a door nearby, that led
    outside. I think it’s reserved for<i> ‘faculty,’ </i>but it was unlocked.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You found an open door, and you didn’t leave!?” Lucifer was unsure whether
    or not he should act proud or furious. “Then why are we waiting around
    here! <i>Move!</i> It’s time to ditch this cesspool excuse for a city!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I second that!” Alecto raised her first in the air.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yes! I <b>third</b> that!” Terrance boomed. He stared to the side
    sheepishly, noticing that Ella was hiding behind Nadia, doing everything in
    her power to stay away from him. Indeed, their knowledge of each other and
    how they had just met up remained classified. This fact did not change even
    as everyone first pinpointed the abandoned wall, then slipped past one by
    one. Certainly, his obfuscation of the truth was persistent.

</p>
<p>
    For the second time, <i>Host</i> Aamon watched his fascinating marauders
    race away, back to Vale. With him were several goons, all of which
    understood that they were <i>not</i> to shoot.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Save the ammo for the real threats, my Purifiers. What you’ve just seen
    was a valuable ally without question. The last of <i>Claudius’s</i> reign…
    Come, now. Supreme Leader Caligula wants us.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Aamon held both hands behind his back and paced over to a station easily
    seen by its three iron chimneys, which were made to frequently spew fumes
    into the atmosphere. Most citizens, upon spotting him, were too scared to
    run or hide. They simply saluted, stating “Serve us, serve many.” Aamon
    didn’t reply.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Within only a few brisk minutes, the prevailed had entered a superior blimp
    made to hold all Servus Officials. Deep inside, a briefing of the day’s
    events took place.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “With all due respect, Supreme Leader, I really think you should see a
    doctor! No man can sustain life with injuries <i>this</i> severe!” Prime
    Solomon pled.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What befalls me is none of your concern.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Quite the contrary, I regret to inform you. Don’t forget, I serve you
    without question. Your wellbeing is of upmost importance to me, as
    tradition dictates. The same applied to your grandfather, and your father:
    Claudius.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“You are forbidden to state his name! Don’t speak!”</i>
    Caligula commanded, then paused before another screech.
    <i>
        “I am the Supreme Leader, now! The infection has evolved me! You are
        beneath me! Know your place, Prime! Speak not of this, again.”
    </i>
    Caligula ordered. A loud bang drew their gaze, as Aamon slammed the
atrium’s doors open. The impact brought a groan from both the doors,    <i>and</i> Caligula.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Supreme Leader. I would very much like you to explain something. On that
    scaffolding, after Team Lance evaded you <i>again,</i> how did several of
    my men end up out of commission?” Aamon’s body-language appeared
    inquisitive. Of course, that was the norm.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I <i>executed</i> them for failing the mission. Your purifiers were
    useless- a waste of resources. And they are not men. Not anymore than you.
    Don’t forget that.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Victor felt it necessary to involve himself. If each of Servus Portum’s
    greatest minds were joining, it was only appropriate he’d make an entrance.
    “He’s <i>mine,</i> actually. Without me, he wouldn’t even be here, and you
    would be lost without an army.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “An army controlled by <i>me.”</i> Aamon still had a small if substantial
    claim to fame. “If you die, <i>Victor,</i> nothing happens. If I die,
    everyone in this room is finished. So you tell <i>me</i> who’s more pivotal
    to the conquest of Remnant,
    <i>
        Master.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Caligula yawned, still dripping with his own blood. “He’s right, you know?
    I never would have expected you to fail so <i>beautifully.</i> Mind telling
    me how you were beaten by a <i>princess</i> and her
    <i>
        slave?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I was bested, it’s true. I caught that little girl, she slipped away due
    to a surprise semblance. <i>You</i> teetered on the edge of death against
    three first years from Vale, mere teenagers that you studied for
    <b>
        weeks!”
        <p>
        </p>
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>“Silence!”</i></b>
    Caligula roared. Fuming with anger, he opened his mouth to shout again.
    Nothing came out, as a concerning <i>fifth</i> entity floated into the
    assembly. This wasn’t the first time the Seer Grimm let itself into
    Caligula’s territory. Whatever had happened in the past, it convinced
    everyone to hush <i>this</i> time.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Caligula?” The messenger mirrored a picture of the speaker.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“The <b>Moth.</b></i>
    Yes, it is I. And that’s <b><i>Supreme</i></b><i> Leader</i> Caligula.”

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>

        “Stop talking. Last time I was here, we discussed my plans. Have you

    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…” Caligula looked back, unsure of what to say. Aamon normally wouldn’t
    put himself in harm’s way, believing his children the better choice for a
    sacrifice, but this time he didn’t think a terrible fate would ensnare him
    for coming to Caligula’s defense.

    “As it turns out, much has transpired since your last visit. I don’t have
    the resources to launch an attack of the austerity you speak of. We need
