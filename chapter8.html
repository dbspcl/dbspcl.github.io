    “Ah, Mister Virtus and Miss Keraseer! How lucky for us all, that I find
myself greeting you two at the <i>Cross</i>    <i>Continental Transmit Tower.</i> What business brings you <i>here</i> to
    begin with?” A member of Beacon Staff intercepted his students near the
    entrance to the grand monument in question. A glowing mid-day sun
    contrasted against the tall tower as a majestic backdrop.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Professor Stam!?” Alecto hissed through the slits of her helmet. “Err, we
    were just, um-“
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We were simply passing through to research Vale, and the surrounding
    villages.” Lucifer spoke for them both.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Aha, I’d gathered that much on my own, Mister Virtus. What I’m asking is,
    <i>
        why?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Should we tell him? If he finds out she’s been absent all this time,
        she might get in trouble. Plus, it’s probably bad news if he finds out
        Selene and Boreas are gonna go snooping around the library.”
    </i>
    Alecto pulled Lucifer aside, murmuring to make sure they couldn’t be heard.
    She overlooked the fact that Stam was mere feet away, and <i>anyone</i> in
    that position could still hear her. Lucifer looked over at the Professor,
    understanding this trivial mistake.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hm. Rather, the brief secrets between teammates should stay secrets!
    Especially for ones of <i>your</i> stature.” He bowed. Lucifer appeared
    completely unaffected by the compliment while his counterpart couldn’t hide
    the flattery in her posture. “I do hope you weren’t expecting any action
    inside the CCT-Tower. Otherwise, I don’t see why you’d bring your weapons.
    You <i>do</i> know we have lockers for that, yes?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “They don’t reach outside the Kingdom- ah!” Alecto caught herself after it
    was too late.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s no problem, Miss Keraseer! I’d be ill-mannered to control what my
    students do outside the confinements of Beacon Academy. As far as I’m
    concerned, a journey away these walls means extra training. Don’t let me
    stop you.” Stam chuckled, softly pacing away.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I think we fooled him.” Alecto gave a thumbs up. All she was rewarded with
    was a sneer and leave of absence. Before the door closed, Alecto ran
    through to join Lucifer. “She still isn’t responding to her scroll, you
    know. Should I try again? Do you think we’ll get any service?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We’re <i>literally inside</i> the CCT-Tower and you’re asking about
    service. Are you out of your mind?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t know, I’m still new to this scroll thing!” She followed him
    through an auditorium of which the most noteworthy structure was a metal
    pillar in the middle, one laced with holographic monitors.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You’ve had it for <i>how</i> long now? And you’re still unfamiliar with
    it.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ugh, not everyone was raised in the technological center of mankind, okay?
    You may have gotten a comfortable life from a family snuggled in a
    prestigious town, but don’t assume the same applies to me.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You disparage assumptions while making up your own. Don’t think you know
    my past.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Tell me about it, then. How about this? You’re pretty familiar with the
    Cross Continental Transmit Centers, huh? Is it possible for them to ever go
    down?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It <i>was</i> Atlas that invented the system, to the ungrateful arms of
    the rest of Remnant. It would take an army or two, or <i>three</i> to take
    down this tower, even if it’s dwarfed by the one in Atlas. I don’t see that
    happening anytime soon, I’m sorry to say.” He thought himself a fool for
    even considering the thought, now meandering in an elevator.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’m not complaining. What floor do we go to?” Alecto pointed at where she
    thought the buttons would be. Only a series of scanners awaited.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hello. Welcome to the CCT. How may I help you?” A female’s voice spoke
    over the speakers.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, cool! Do we go down, or up?” She cheered.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“We’re <i>on</i> the lowest floor<i>,</i> imbecile. What, do you want to go    <i>lower?</i> How about the secret dungeon?” Lucifer chided.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We have a <i>secret dungeon?</i> Is there like a <i>‘secret dungeon’ </i>
    option, and if so, how is the <i>secret dungeon </i>a
    <b>
        secret?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I was joking. Please explain to me the long winded, convoluted reason why
    there’d be a secret dungeon in Vale’s CCT-Tower?” He noticed a batch of
    civilians waited in front of the elevator, not quite on board with sharing
    the elevator with two bickering opposites of war. On one side the ideal
    paradigm of military prowess, on the other a horned cavalier cloaked in
    shining armor. Needless to say, Lucifer moved things along.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Take us to the <i>Chronicle of Memoirs.'”</i> He demanded.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It seems that area is restricted for authorized personnel only. If that
    applies to you, could you please place your scroll on the terminal to
    verify your identity?” The semi-monotone script continued. Lucifer didn’t
    hesitate to comply. “Perfect. Thank you, Mister Virtus.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“Wow. How many people get to claim they’re authorized personnel?    <i>None.</i> So you’re top dog around <i>here,</i> too... I’m pretty sure
    I’m like one more one-up away from locking you in my semblance. Sure I
    might get a headache from keeping you trapped, but it couldn’t be worse
    than the one brought on by your incessant babbling. I can’t wait to beat
    you whenever we discuss kingdom lore, religion, or the Old Arts.” Alecto
    droned on.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Huh. <i>‘Kingdom lore.’</i> I’ll give you that one. <i>Religion- </i>
    Another term for <b>fiction.</b> As if that matters. Don’t expect me to
    ever entertain this foolishness. Gods and goddesses are not
    <i>
        real.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Quite the contrary. It’s foolish to deny the impact legends and heroes can
    have on those devoted. Why did <i>you</i> decide to be a Huntsman? I bet
    you were inspired by someone, right?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Classified.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What?” She didn’t quite catch his response.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Classified. I cannot tell. Sorry. As for the <i>Old Arts,</i> feel free to
    do what I could not. Explain why <i>you’re</i> here, or at the very least
    what these <i>‘Old Arts’ </i>are.” The door opened, revealing a large but
    dim coliseum. The room was stocked full of computer tiers, each one
    astonishingly powerful. Lucifer and Alecto surveyed the rows, taking a
    considerable amount of time to reach the end.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “The Old Arts- not to be confused with the Old <i>Fang,</i> are considered
    by those who practice it to not only be a method of combat, not a way of
    life, but a state of being. You’ve already seen it, believe or not. Every
    time you’ve seen me fight, I’ve demonstrated skillful techniques that
    respect the Old Arts. Even against you. But I’m nowhere near perfect.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “You don’t have to tell <i>me.”</i> Lucifer took a jab at her.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hey! You make it very difficult to adhere to the Arts. As a lady I’m
    supposed to <i>‘hold thy tongue’</i> and <i>‘turn thou other cheek.’</i> I
    haven’t done a very good job of that, have I? Fortunately, the nature of
    the Old Arts is to learn. We <i>must</i> work at it.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We’re the same in that respect, then. Enough, we’re here.” Lucifer sat
    down at the last machine and began vigorously typing. After receiving an
    error and not being allowed into the system, he held his scroll up to the
    display. “<i>Bingo.</i>” He was in.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How did you do that?” Alecto was first impressed with his keyboard speed,
    hardly being able to type at all herself, then his ability to bypass the
    precautions.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “If you’re the right person, they let you right in. I’m allowed.” Lucifer
    payed little attention to her, focused on manipulating the interface with a
    few more scroll confirmations.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Why are <i>you</i> the right person?” She asked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Classified.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Welcome to the Chronicle of Memoirs, Virtus. What do you wish to
        know?”
    </i>
    A digital assistant distinctly different than the one in the elevator spat
    out instructions. It was uncanny.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Make sure you keep this between us, understood? I <b>am</b> allowed here,
    but it’s best I use the Chronicle as sparingly as possible. It leaves a
    trail of what we ask, and it catalogues our misadventures.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I get it. So, now we’re going to ask this voice where Nadia is, and it’ll
    magically have the answer?” Alecto still didn’t fathom the plan.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Not quite. If we have a lead, we might be able to track something down
    through specific questions. The <i>CCTS</i> has an extensive record of
    everything if you know where to look. It’s just a matter of recognizing the
    system’s dynamics. Therefore, is there anything particularly noteworthy
    about Nadia?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well, she’s got those needles. They use venom, that’s pretty strange.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Chronicle. </i>
    Where do you find strains of venom?” Lucifer put in a command.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Narrowing the search.”</i>
    It loaded, then brought up many hundreds of results.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Um… Chronicle? Are there any areas where invisibility semblances are more
    common?” Alecto caught onto the strategy.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Narrowing the search.” It continued, processing the list of unique traits
    and anomalies about their missing friend until one last inquiry from Alecto
    pushed the data over the edge.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What do you know about ritualistic hoods?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“The search is complete.”</i>
    One source was unveiled, a single file now presented in the middle of the

“Huh. I have no idea what this means. The    <b><i> ‘Covenant of Dukes?’” </i></b>He read out the three words with extra
    contemplation. Tapping it brought up a short but eerily enlightening
    article. After all this whittling down, they stumbled upon only a paragraph
    of which they read in silence

        “Although the Chronicle has no answer to your problem, if you’ve been
        led to this page there’s an entity who does. The Covenant of Dukes is a
        mostly unknown organization off the grid. Great efforts have been taken
        to keep its existence a secret, but after negotiating with CCTS
        executives several times, and after many attempts to erase itself from
        the Chronicle of Memoirs, a reprieve was granted. This single reference
        of the Covenant would be its only trace in the event somebody useful to
        its cause would stumble upon it. What little information could be
        compiled outlines that within the Covenant of Dukes resides an
        ‘all-knowing’ disciple waiting for an oracle.”

    “…Okay, so when they can’t find anything, it pulls up a secondary
questionnaire. We’ve just been redirected to a <b>living</b>    <i>‘chronicle’</i> at this point. Some help this was.” Lucifer sighed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t give up just yet. This <b><i>‘all knowing disciple’</i></b> might,
    as the name suggests, actually <i>know</i> something. Amazing, right? I’m a
    genius. Obviously he knows about Nadia, otherwise he wouldn’t have been
    narrowed down in the search.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What are you suggesting? That we go to this <i>Covenant of Dukes</i> and
    confront the disciple?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Why not? Look, there’s loose coordinates right there. Even if the records
    are slim, we still get a general idea of where to go. The Covenant is just
    south of here. It says he’s waiting for an <i>‘Oracle.</i>’ Maybe that
    could be us! I mean, we were planning on leaving Vale anyway. Do you want
    to find Nadia or not?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “…Fine. But first, we need to stop by the dorm rooms. I’m guessing this
    symbol will guide us when we <i>do</i> embark?” Lucifer pointed at the
    screen, clarifying what he meant while entering the coordinates into his
    scroll. Under the passage watched a runic illustration depicting some sort
    of pointed mask. Without a shred of further discourse, they left the
    Chronicle of Memoirs and the Cross Continental Transmit Center altogether.
    Their dormitory was overtaken in no time flat.

<p>
    “W-Who are you!?” Alecto had become accustomed to walking in on uninvited
    guests at this point. Lucifer was far less hospitable though, pulling his
    gun on the cretin. Anyone would have, considering the man’s appearance. He
wore a brown wavy coat, and had hellish <i>mist</i> where his legs    <i>would</i> have been.

    “Augustus. I’m the Warden at the facility of the same name.” He held his
    shriveled hand out.

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Where we <i>aren’t.</i> You should have stayed there.” Lucifer threatened,
    still aiming at him. Alecto had the sense to quell his frenzy.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Wait, stop! This guy’s the leader of Augustus Correctional! Nadia talked
    about him a lot! It’s great to meet you, sir. You’re ten times scarier in
    person!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Aha. Thank you.”
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    “What are you doing here? H-How did you even find our dorm rooms?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I knew I was looking for Team Lance, you can thank Nadia for that. And I’m
    good friends most of the staff here. It wasn’t that difficult- there are
    far more mind-bending investigations taking place at the prison nearly
    every day. Nadia knew about <i>that,</i> she was part of several prior to
    her departure.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How so?” Lucifer lowered his hand-cannon.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well I must admit, she came to me the same day she left.” Augustus fixed
    his hat then glasses, respectively.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “She did!?” They blurted in unison. “Why didn’t you stop her?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “She was already determined. I can control almost everything happening in
    the walls of my great asylum, but I can’t control <i>her.</i> The point is,
    I came here for, well, a couple reasons. First, she has a good friend-“
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ella.” Lucifer nodded.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, you know. Perfect. She’s an interesting specimen, an anomaly neither I
    nor Vale’s files can piece together. I was hoping a train ride to Atlas
    would uncover something, and if you saw her in person, you’d know why.
    Surprise, she’s back and we’ve learned <i>nothing.</i> But more
    importantly, her bodyguard’s gone missing.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Who was it? Did they get hurt?” Alecto gulped.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t know. And frankly, I don’t care. He was a dangerous patient
    climbing the ranks of Remnant’s Most Wanted. <i>Dimitri,</i> as he was
    known. His tracking device was impenetrable- a pinnacle of Atlesian
    engineering, and yet we find ourselves <i>here.”</i> Augustus tossed the
    wrist guard to Lucifer. It was sliced down the middle, and whatever was
    responsible was no doubt leagues beyond anything Atlas could provide. “The
    tracker recorded everything. Hit play.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    They listened to Dimitri and Nobody’s conversation without interruption
    until Dimitri mentioned the possibility of a Delphic being involved.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “A <b><i>Delphic!?”</i></b> Alecto yanked the device away, pausing it.
    “This guy was negotiating with a <i>Delphic!?</i> Argh, the nerve of him!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What? What’s a Delphic?” Lucifer seemed lost. Augustus was able and
    willing to deliver the same explanation he gave to Dimitri, but Alecto
    wasn’t having any of it.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Delphics</i>

</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “They’re despicable amalgamations of human and Grimm! How <b>dare</b>
        any remain on Remnant! They’re impure, a bastardization of the order of

    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I think he gets it!” Augustus twisted the gadget away from her with the
    use of his black-fog inducing semblance and hit play. Alecto struggled to
    continue listening, clearly shaken. The recording ended once Dimitri
    severed his bonds.
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “His sword is <i>‘undoubtedly the sharpest in <b>all</b> of Remnant.’</i>
    What a joke. Why are we even listening to this?” Lucifer checked his own
    knife.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It might lead back to Nadia. Nobody is responsible for the rising Grimm
    attacks in Forever Fall, I’m sure of it. If Nadia made a detour through
    there, she could have been captured. And more importantly, if you two are
    going to be searching for Nadia, asking about who this Nobody is might help
    all three of us.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It seems like you’re just tacking this on us so we can do your
    investigation for you. Do you even care about Nadia?” Lucifer saw through
    the lie. The warden drooped his shoulders and craned his neck back.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Fine. I just <i>had</i> to get that Delphic incident off my chest, but I
    couldn’t do it at the Correctional Facility. This is the only place I knew
    for <b>certain</b> the Administrator won’t overhear me. I lied to him, I
    neglected to tell him about the Delphics. I need you two to destroy
    Dimitri’s tracking device. And… Truth be told, I didn’t come here for
    finding Nadia <i>nor</i> Nobody. I came because she talked about Team Lance
    non-stop, and she was about the closest thing I ever <i>had</i> to a
    friend...”
    <i>
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    There had never been as much silence in the dwelling as there was right
    then. Everyone dropped their heads in despair. Lucifer looked at Alecto.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    She nodded. “Okay, we’ll help you. We’ll keep a hold of your radio-thing,
    and ask about <i>Nobody</i> on our voyage. Although I could hardly see what
    use you could have for a <i>Delphic</i> other than killing it. Right now
    we’re going to this place we found out about in the Chronicle-“
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We’re going to the <i>Covenant of Dukes!”</i> Lucifer whooshed in front of
    her to put his hand over her mouth. Now was as good a time as any to
    collect one of Nadia’s vestments once he confirmed she wouldn’t reveal the
    Chronicle.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“What!? Really?</i>
    I-I really don’t think that’s a good idea. You shouldn’t do it.” Augustus
    rubbed the back of his neck, suddenly nervous.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Why not? You know the place?” She hypothesized.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t. It just sounds frightening. I wouldn’t recommend going to a place
    like that right now, you should really try one of the less dangerous
    settlements.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “We’ve already been to most of them, and I’ve got a feeling this’ll be a
    keeper. We should have left already anyway. I look forward to our next
    meeting! Bye!” Alecto set precedent by leaving in a brisk fashion. Augustus
    didn’t have a chance to say anything else.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah, me too. You’ve just made things a <i>lot</i> more difficult for me.”
    He uttered, frowning at the now closed door. Still hovering a foot off the
    ground, the twinkling vapor constituting his lower half began to envelop
    him completely. Apparently another perk of his semblance was the ability to
    teleport, as when the smoke cleared there was nothing left.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>

    The coordinates from their studies was only slightly further than Summit’s
    Blight, but was distinguished by being in a completely different direction.
    All the numbers led to was a smooth but cracked dam. Perfectly formed, the
    mountain was. But the height of it, and the empty courtyard in which it was
    slammed into gave the migrants an odd feeling. This blockade stretched
    across the entire landscape.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, look at that!” Alecto pointed to an area of the barrier tainted with
    markings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s just a bunch of random crevices. Don’t be… <i>Wait a second.</i>
    Alright, I stand corrected.” Lucifer recalled the symbol of the mask seen
    in the Chronicle of Memoirs. From memory alone, he could see how the nine
    etches in the mountain, if rearranged, could form the insignia. And then he
    realized touching them swapped them based on pressure.
    <i>
        “So it’s a puzzle?”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hmm. How about this?” She said, joining in by tackling the right side. If
    they hadn’t seen the image representing this Covenant, it would have been
    impossible. Only with the answer could the obscure hallmark be remade.
    Failure, success, and then pause. That was the routine. Copious variations
    on the method finally allowed them to line up the pieces. The gravel upon
    which they stood rumbled, and the bluff split itself right down the middle,
    separating the mask into two halves.
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>

    The extremely flamboyant mechanism for entry exposed a tremendous catwalk
    held by embellished pilasters. It took minutes for the pair to brave the
    overpass on foot.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Great. Do you think this is enough? I don’t think Grimm of <i>any</i> size
could breach this defense. Talk about overkill. What could the    <i>disciple</i> possibly be expecting?” Lucifer identified a colossal door
    mounted in their path. It didn’t take much to pinpoint. Compared to the
    splintery archaic entrance to the Anti-Citadel, this one was likely several
    times taller, and appeared nigh indestructible. Showered with intricate
    engravings, and bolted to huge walls with similar grandiosity- the entrance
    to this Covenant instantly landed a spot among the greatest monuments
    they’d seen so far in Remnant.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Wow… So, how do we approach this?” Alecto looked straight up, observing
    how the acropolis was trapped by sheer cliffs, not unlike a broken snow
    globe.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Let’s try knocking.” Lucifer advised. Neither felt confident enough to
    actually approach the gates, so Alecto picked up a mess of stray rocks and
    lobbed them at the entrance. In order to make sure her hits could be heard,
    she had to put all her strength into the throws. The booming sound was
    impossible to miss even in the depths the hidden bastille. Now it was
    Lucifer’s turn to gaze upward. He saw a formation of black silhouette peer
    over the wall, watch them for an uncomfortable amount of time, then
    disappear.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The double doors were pushed open from inside by around twenty identical
    minions, with about ten more walking through the newly formed opening. It
    was clear who was in charge. Leading the parade was a tall individual
    wearing opulent robes. The person was pinned by a spiky ceramic mask privy
    to a permanent grin, clearly reflective of the Covenant’s emblem. The most
    shocking aspect of this stranger, besides the mask, were his legs. Or lack
    thereof. Both the limbs were replaced with lanky, razor sharp peg-legs.

        “Of all the places within Remnant, <b>nobody</b> finds this place by
        accident. And with <b>infantry</b> of this sort, and <b>armor</b> like
        that, the question begs. <b>Why are you here?”</b>
    </i>
    His query was punctuated by the metal clanks of his gait.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “W-We’re here to find our friend. We were hoping this place would do the
    trick.” Alecto cooperated. The man with the mask settled still for a
    moment, then turned to recoil.

<p>
    “What is this place?” Lucifer marveled at his surroundings. They were being
    toured through stone bridges, hallways, and theatres. No corner of the gray
    fortress was unfinished, everything was perfectly carved and organized. And
    with the presence of clone-like guards everywhere to be seen, it was clear
    how much of a living, complete stronghold the Covenant was.

    stand ready for him at the mention of their name.

<p>

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “How did you know that!?” Lucifer advanced his way in front of the new

    looked like, was hidden behind the mask.

    “…Just tell us where our friend is. Then we’ll gladly leave. Her name is
    Nadia, she always wore one of these. She left them all before she
    disembarked.” Lucifer showed him one of her traditional hoods. Raphael
    analyzed the piece of clothing without much thought, eventually finding
    himself taken aback with the emblem on the bonnet. “Exquisite. Whoever wore
    this was a
    <i>
        Descendant.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <br/>
    “A <i>Descendant?</i> What does that mean?” Lucifer asked. Alecto reached
    for the cloak.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Would it bother you if I kept this? With it, I could do some research and
    help you find Nadia. You want to find her, right?” He did a good job
    guilt-tripping them into allowing him his desires to keep the article.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Of course. It’s yours.” She dared not inquest her own loyalty. “Oh, we
    were wondering, she was good friends with a man named Augustus.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “…Really?”
        <p>

</p>
<p>
    “Yep. The day she left, he sent a crook named Dimitri to Atlas through the
    Forever Fall Forest. His tracking device recorded a conversation he had
    with an outsider called <i>‘Nobody.’</i> From it, we’ve deduced Dimitri
    encountered a <b><i>Delphic.”</i></b> As usual, Alecto spat out the word
    with intense hate.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Delphic?</i>
    Do tell.” Raphael giggled, leading them into an amphitheater.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Delphics are scum, that’s all you need to know. If you see a humanoid with
the physique of a Grimm, you’ll know you’ve found one. And apparently    <i>Nobody</i> thinks it’s welcome in Remnant. I don’t really see how, but
    Augustus suggested this incident could lead us to Nadia. In their dialogue,
it became clear Nobody used a sword, and described it as    <i>‘undoubtedly the sharpest in <b>all</b> of Remnant.’</i>”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Really?”</i>
    Raphael froze for a moment. Alecto and Lucifer assumed he had an answer,
    and was reveling in the moment of clarity. “…Not a clue, I’m afraid. I do
    not know where your friend is. My apologies.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Ugh, this is useless. First the Chronicle has nothing, now <i>you</i> have
    nothing.” Alecto whined.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Do what you will. You can even explore my castle, but only as long you
    tell me anything you think might help the search. Anything could help,
    simply call for me. Don’t go anywhere you’re not supposed to. The populace
    will alert me, and I will be there.” Raphael probed for more information.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I’ll look around, maybe that’ll finally yield answers. It’s clear I’m not
    going to find anything from you. Enjoy each other.” Lucifer left. He’d
    occasionally bump into a Shrewd, but all things considered he was grateful
    not to receive their stares for being so different. Tiberius: Covenant of
    Dukes was big enough that he almost began to think himself lost. There were
    so many empty churches, forums, and dining halls that he found himself
    pondering the possibility of trickery. <i>Could this castle be alive?</i>
    It wouldn’t be the first time a foreign region hoodwinked him.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Resigned to roam around without any purpose, Lucifer eventually encountered
    a different scene. A narrowing staircase led to a huge vault door, and to
    say it was <i>guarded</i> was a gross understatement. There were likely
    over twenty Shrewds watching the gateway, each armed with a blade and
    crossbow. They were all lined up along the walls, encapsulating the
    stair-well towards the fort. Perhaps it was boredom, perhaps it was a
    desire for answers, but Lucifer decided he should infiltrate the armory.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    There was no feasible angle for subterfuge as long as Raphael’s men sat
    prone and concentrated on security. If he fought them, no doubt Raphael
would descend upon him.    <i>Could he <b>fight</b> Raphael? Was it even worth it?</i> “Nadia could do
    it…” He groaned in frustration. Getting inside without being seen at all
    was the best option.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Shrewds set their sights on Lucifer, as he figured the best idea was to
    crawl down the shooting gallery under his cape. A couple of the marksmen
    looked at each other in bewilderment, then hopped from their podiums to
    check the red cloth. They prodded the bundle of cloth a handful of times,
    waiting while all others watched until one of them flicked it away with
    their saber.
    <i>
        Nothing.
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lucifer used this opportunity to slip past the spectators into the
    mausoleum. He sacrificed his cape, but it may very well have been a worthy
    sacrifice. So far, nothing but the comparatively perplexing architecture
    peaked his interest. The cobwebs didn’t help. There were far less torches
    inside. Numerous flights of stairs brought him to a circular chamber. The
    floor was stained with moisture. Sculpted pillars and a cloudy atmosphere
    couldn’t distract from the violet flame in the middle, some sort of
    ritualistic pyre sleeping in a golden cradle, its heat searing even from a
    distance.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What kind of mindless gibberish is this?” He couldn’t believe his eyes.
    Every corner held an altar decorated with recently extinguished candles. He
    swept the dust off a nearby mural out of pure curiosity. It depicted four
    basic figures standing against a fifth. Inscriptions in an extrinsic
    language covered <i>everything,</i> but one mundane list of words he could
read at the very bottom set the tone for the rest.    <i>“Slayer, Blood, Scourge, Spawn, Arbiter.” </i>he read out.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Another one, chosen at random and requiring Lucifer to slog a great
    distance due to the enclosure’s size, illustrated what he could only assume
    to be the same five idols standing below a star. Much like before, the only
    legible text recited a cryptic phrase. <i>“First Bewitchment.”</i>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Huntsman-in-training turned his attention to the fire. As he drew
    closer, it’s earthly but unnatural glow gleamed brighter. Lucifer couldn’t
    resist reaching for it. The brazen cinders called to him.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Just a few minutes earlier, when he split up with his partner, she spent
    her time conversing with Raphael, hoping she could squeeze more insight out
    of him. Hesitant to jump in, however, they walked in silence.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “I thought there weren’t any Keraseers left.” He stated.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “W-What do you know about me? Or the Keraseers?” She sputtered.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    ”I recognize that mail. And those swords? There’s no mistaking it. You are
    a
    <i>
        Keraseer.”
        <p>
        </p>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Fine. Is that a problem for you?” She stomped her feet, suddenly on the
    defensive.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No, no, nothing like that! Not yet, anyway. And your friend, a Virtus.
    Some may consider it an honor to have both a Keraseer and a Virtus in their
    presence. I’m exempt from that charm, fortunately. And after all that build
    up, you two are here looking for a <i>Descendant.</i> How poetic.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Why do you keep calling Nadia a Descendant? How do you know about that?
    Not even Lucifer knows. And speaking of which, what’s so special about him
    anyway? Or Selene for that matter?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Selene Virtus. So she’s here in Vale, too? Hahaha. You understand so
        little. Nadia hasn’t told any of you about her past. Is <b>he</b>

        dark too, haven’t you?”
    </i>
    <i>Dead silence.</i>
    “
    <i>
        Oh, you have. How wonderful, it’s an entire team of liars.”

    “It matters not! How dare you insult a Keraseer! Have at you, then! Let us
    see who’ll prove victorious, you coward!” She took a battle stance. He
    simply laughed, still intertwining his fingers, not at all intimidated. But
    suddenly, before she rushed forward, his attitude shifted. His head jolted
    to the side.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>“The Sacred Embers!”</i></b>
    He gasped. Instantly, he broke into a sprint, blazing through the Covenant
    of Dukes with speed so swift, Alecto didn’t have a chance at catching him.
    Raphael navigated the corridors and gardens expertly. It wasn’t long before
    he found the guarded staircase. The Shrewds made way for him without
    instruction.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Within the divine passage, Lucifer was entranced by the Sacred Embers,
    inching his outstretched fingers toward the flames. Before contact was
    made, a hand ripped his own away. It took him a period of confusion to
    garner back his senses.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>“What are you trying to do!?”</i></b>
    Raphael screamed in his face, tugging him away from the prized suttee.
    Every one of his grunts funneled into the room after Alecto, each waiting
    for a signal to fire.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What is the meaning of this?” Lucifer jerked his arm away.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Merely the old antiques of a historian, nothing more, nothing less. And
    nothing of interest you two. You should leave, now.” Raphael’s sudden but
    level-headed resolution convinced Lucifer to trudge outward, past Alecto.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “C’mon. He’s right. Why do we care about this?” He lowered her steel.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “But, Lucifer!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He’s not going to tell us where Nadia is. What’s the point?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        “Listen to him, Alecto. Do as your team leader says, always. Never
        betray his rule.”
    </i>
    Raphael stood in front of the Sacred Embers, making sure there was no
    chance of trespass.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Grr! Your time will come!” She retreated outside, wherein Vale’s
    representatives were overseen by a congregations of Shrewds. Raphael stayed
    put and walked over to relight most of the candles with a scorching piece
    of wood from the fire. Throughout the journey out of Tiberius: Covenant of
    Dukes, Alecto consistently glanced backwards, reaffirming the notion that
    they were <i>not</i> being followed. Out the main gates they went, and that
    was the end of that.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Fantastic. That didn’t accomplish anything. In fact we lost progress,
    because now he’s got one of Nadia’s hoods, my cape, and a bunch of
    information. A complete waste of my time.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s <i>our</i> time, actually.” Alecto replicated the strategy from
    before, throwing rocks at Raphael front door, although this time out of
spite. In the back of her mind, his words regarding secrecy never left.    <i>“C-Could they really be hiding something from me?”</i> She then
    remembered the supposed amount of skeletons hiding in her own closet.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “C’mon. We shouldn’t waste any more, if it matters that much to you.”
    Lucifer began the long trip across the bridge, back to the beloved Academy.
    While Lucifer had Alecto accompany him in a search into the deep recesses
    of Vale hidden from the public eye, he had tasked a set of equally
    important allies to do their own research in Beacon’s library. And with
    night cascading upon the heroes without a hint of benevolence, now was the
    perfect time for such an undertaking.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Our peers like to use the library as a gathering ground to socialize, play
    games, or just loiter around. Therefore I’m not surprised Professor Stam
    hid his antique tome collection in the bookshelves. Who would ever look for
    books in a bookshelf? It’s laughable! Unless you’re <i>me,</i> of course.”
    Boreas attended Selene to the furthermost shelf on the second level and
    began pulling the books out. He was right, behind a set of encyclopedias
    were a stack of withered yellow writings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
“He hid his secret textbooks in a library behind encyclopedias?    <i>Genius!</i> Who would ever read an encyclopedia?” Selene piped.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t go too fast, we’ll have to put these back the way we found them.
    It’s a risk to do this, but anything for Nadia. Considering the time, I
    doubt anyone will intrude. The only reason someone would come here at night
    is to fall asleep. Unless you’re <i>me,</i> of course.” He repeated
    himself.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Got it! What should we look through first?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “She’s kind of old-timey, is she not? She wears those hoods religiously. So
    here’s one on <i>religion.”</i> Boreas handed her a fresh scripture.
    Selene, precocious as she was, skimmed through it and soaked in the basic
    gist of everything. One chapter covered a multitude of supposed deities.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Huh. According to this, there’s a bunch of extra gods I’ve never heard of.
    There’s one associated with war named <i>Odynavus.</i> And another one who
    dealt with loyalty and glory, named <i>Troy.</i> Oh, this one seems
important, there’s a lot of information about him. He’s called    <i>Keres...</i> But these guys can’t actually be real, right?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Simply a different belief system than ours. No more real than any entity
    in which you or I place our worship. Even a man of science has to take a
    leap of faith, sometimes.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Why does Professor Stam have these anyway?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “My understanding is he researched them extensively to help navigation in
    Summit’s Blight. I saw him with one myself during the field trip.
    Fortunately, there’s all manner of extras for us to find.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    They read in silence, almost enjoying themselves with literature whether it
    was real or not. Selene seemed disappointed to find something with any
    connection to her situation, since it meant playtime was over.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Hey, here it mentions <b>‘The Grand Gatekeeper’ </b>and gives us details
    about it! Maybe we can finally take down <i>Galathyn</i> for good!” She
    confided.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Galathyn? Explain.”

    “It’s that Grimm in Summit’s Blight. Nomad told me all about him, but this
    is on a whole other level! It says here that it’s been thriving in Remnant
    as long as anyone’s remembered. I-It’s kind of hard for me to read this
    cursive, though. Err…
    <i>
        ‘Heed its legs, for the pikes of its bony stilts remain tipped with an
        ancient poison. Not a single documented survivor of its strength exists
        save for myself, with everyone else succumbing to the arms of death
        mere minutes after being punctured. The secret to its own demise is
        beset in the unknown, but my estimations is that a dose of its own
        medicine would prove equally fatal. There is so very much work left to
        be done.’
    </i>
    Umm… Nomad never said anything about that. Do you think he was hiding
    information from us?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Care to explain who Nomad is? Not one of those magic-men read about in
    these books, I presume?” Boreas flipped through the pages of his own
    selection of documents. Half of them appeared to be printed. They could
    clearly tell the other half was hand-written, all by the same individual.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nope! He’s an ally from Summit’s Blight! He told me how to navigate around
    myself! It’s pretty tricky though, it has to do with the phases of the
    moon.” Selene said.

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, all the more reason to get my telescope back in use. Anyway, I’ve
    learned all sorts of interesting lessons, but nothing that would lead back
    to Nadia. One thing that did ruffle my feathers, however, was the mention
    of a sort of collection of antiques called Relics. And I’m not talking
    about the keepsakes from our initiation in the Emerald Forest. ”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s right, Relics!” Selene squawked, before covering her mouth.

<p>
    “Oh, you know of them?” Boreas loomed overhead.

    <p>
    </p>

<p>
    “N-No, you misheard me. I just, <i>err,</i> coughed. Seriously.” She threw
    in a few obviously fake chokes.

    “…Okay then. Whoever wrote this was being strangely discreet about the
    purpose of the relics, however many there may be. That’s what makes it
    stand out. I was able to gather that each one was hidden by another
    unspecified being. I haven’t the slightest clue of the specifics.
    Apparently they’re important enough not to talk about on paper, I’m
    guessing in the event this falls into the wrong hands… If you were going to
    hide something crucially important, you’d put it in Remnant’s greatest
    labyrinth. You know what that sounds like?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>

<p>
    “…Summit’s Blight?” She theorized.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Exactly. Maybe the White Fang, or this <i>Nomad</i> is searching for it.
    It would make sense, and it would also explain…” He slowly lifted the Beryl
    Rhinestone. “W-Wait a minute!? Could this be it?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “What, a relic? No, I-It can’t be. If Nomad was after it, he wouldn’t have
    given it away. Not to mention he, at one point, got his hands on… Uh,
    n-never mind.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Well, it’s a great possibility he didn’t know! And if this is in fact the
    truth, we’ve got the White Fang cornered!”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Um… We can only hope. It’s not like we can ask anyone about it. Wait!
    Look!” Selene clutched another textbook, this one stamped with the same
    iconic label seen on Nadia’s clothes. So far her brand was turning out to
    be a pivotal clue in finding her. Boreas caught her drift with ease, and
    held one half of the cover so they could read together. After a scribbled
    foreword, which was looked over with incredible disinterest, they found a
    good starting point to compile whichever details seemed relevant.

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“The Origin of an Amaryllis.”</i>
    Boreas recited the first chapter’s name.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Ahem.</i>
    What could two promising young minds possible need with an elder’s
    treasures?” Somebody tapped Boreas’s shoulder.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “P-Professor Stam!?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t mind me, Mister Zale. Mind yourself. I don’t think <i>you</i> would
    appreciate your old collection being soiled by grasping hands and prying
    eyes. And you too, Miss Virtus? Isn’t it past curfew?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Professor, w-we were just trying to, um-” Selene failed at rallying any
    substantial defense.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s no problem, Miss Virtus. I trust neither of you saw anything too
    important, yes? Just the rambled teachings of a seasoned <i>scribe.</i> Run
    along now, just don’t let me catch either of you doing it again.” Stam
    smiled, watching Boreas file the fables back into place. His two students
    whispered to each other in a rushed fashion, contemplating whether or not
    to pull a third party into their quest.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, um, Professor?” Selene made the first move in dashing up beside him.
    “We’ve been looking everywhere, trying to find Nadia for quite some time
    now. She been missing ever since our fight with Lucifer. And we really miss
    her. We were just hoping your books might have a clue as to where she went,
    or who she was.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Miss Flora didn’t tell you much about herself, did she?”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “No… But she was such a great friend. I really wish things were different…
    Aha, I guess I just had this idolized vision of what it would be like in
    Vale. My fault for setting expectations so high. I never thought my team
    would fall apart like this.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Nonsense, Miss Virtus. You and your team exemplify not only the standard
    for this <i>combat</i> school, but to the other teams. Just look at you and
    Miss Keraseer. I’d be hard-pressed to find a more exceptional partnership.
    And your team leader? I don’t think I need to explain how admirable the
    relationship between all four of you is.”
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “He’s got a point, you know. If only my team was as dutiful.” Boreas set a
    hand on Selene’s shoulder.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Y-You’re right. Maybe, if Nadia really is gone for good, we can visit her
    in Mistral sometime! I’m sure she’d love to see us again! Even Lucifer! I
    already can’t wait to travel away and see the look on her face once I’ve
    finished training my semblance! But one thing I’ve been thinking is, if
    she’s gone, how will Team Lance continue with only three members?” She
    sprung out of the gloom of pessimism.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t worry, Miss Virtus. I will take care of everything. Run along, now.”
    He put full weight on a convenient pedestal, stopping at the exit to the
    library. Boreas and Selene pranced away without a hitch, back to their
    dorms were they belonged.
