<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center'><i>Entry 9: <span style='color:#806000'>Let’s Make Memories
Together</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Her own
helmet spied amidst her slumber, hanging on the door-hanger. It was the
generally the first thing Alecto saw when she arose in the morning as it
substituted a subtle reminder not just for her motivations, but to <i>put it
on.</i> She wouldn’t be caught dead outside this makeshift sanctuary without
it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hmm.” She
emerged from the bedsheets, yawning. Without any visual indication of the sun’s
rising nor where her scroll sat, time was a true mystery. There was no light
inside. Therefore, she’d developed a natural sense of the hour through sheer
need. “Grr! Never matter! <i>This day will fall like the rest! Hya!” </i>The
closet door snapped open. Surely another one of Alecto’s coveted forward
entrance-kicks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Do you ever
try the nob? Anything other than a normal entrance probably damages the door.” Selene
grinned. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“That <i>was</i>
a normal entrance. Would you like to see a crazy one?” Alecto set a hand on the
nearby sword and lowered her visor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Save it for
the grimm.” Lucifer said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It’s what
I’m best at, really. The day I lose to a grimm is the day I’ll finally shut my
mouth for good-“ </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Can that day
be <i>today?”</i> He sighed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“No way!
Today we’re going to have fun! Say goodbye to outside meddling and hello to
team bonding!” Selene cuddled Merlin, cross-legged on her blankets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Besides
going on adventures, perfecting teamwork, and mocking each other, what do we do
for fun anyway?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Team Blazer
does all kind of whacky stuff. It’s to be expected when you’ve got two rivals,
a faunus hook-slinger, and a scarecrow. I even hear they have board games. Sometime
the yelling can be heard from here.” Selene joked. <br>
<br>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We’ve got
to have something in here to match that! There’s no way I’m getting shown up by
a bunch of weaklings!” Alecto ruffled through some nearby drawers, eventually
succumbing to the bottom-most one in a desperate attempt to cling onto victory.
But unlike the last couple, this trunk held something far more special than notebooks,
clothes, dust, or assorted trinkets. It sheltered the prized <i>black knight
pieces</i> from initiation. “…Hey guys, remember these?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“How could I
forget? And believe me, I try.” Lucifer grunted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Aw, c’mon.
It wasn’t that bad. Sure we had a feud of sorts, but without it we wouldn’t
have formed such a great team. It was there we killed our first grimm together.
The Grover deserved as much mercy.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Selene and
Merlin exchanged glances, recalling the distant events as provoked. “Yeah, and
that was the first time I’d killed a grimm, period. This <i>little guy</i> took
most of the work, granted.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hey!
Without me you would have never reached the temple. Though, with that first
kill of yours, we’d be toast. Who am I kidding, one single grimm is no match
for me!” Alecto quipped. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Except for
that Nevermore. You can thank my haste for your assembly, and I suppose I can
too. Admit it though, I had you beat up there.” The leader joined in. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Please.</i>
I let you win. What am I saying, you didn’t win! You cheated, and ran away. A
real warrior would have joined me in the fall!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“No thanks.
I saved my energy for Grover, and-“ </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“And <i>me.</i>
You tackled me, remember?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I mistook
you for an enemy. It happens a lot.” He smirked under the mask. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Whatever.
We took out Grover, and got these! As a team.” She held up one of the two
knights. “That means something. You were there, Selene was there, I was there,
and…” She caught herself, watching the gap of dust outline where the trophy
was. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“She’s still
part of our memories, and vice versa. We’ll never forget her, no matter what.”
Lucifer walked over to ensure Nadia’s bed was made, and all her robes were
neatly folded. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You’re
finally starting to sound regretful.” Alecto sassed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Regretful?</i>
Of course I am… What do you think I’m doing right now? I want her things to be
in order for when she comes back… <i>Argh, forget it!</i> She’s never coming
back!” He gave up and swept his arm across the covers, scattering her mattress
into a state of disrepair. “How could I be such a <i>fool!?</i> She’s gone
because of me. I just wish, considering how fond those memories between all
four of us are, we could have made a few more.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Well, we
can always form new ones. Let’s make memories <i>together.</i> There’s nothing
in here, so why don’t we crash by Team Blazer?” Selene sat up and stretched. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Let’s do
it.” Alecto returned the chess piece onto its dust-surrounded footprint, whereupon
she realized there was no <i>second</i> piece. The other knight bonding Team
Lance together was missing. “Wait a second. Where did the other piece go?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It’s not
there?” Lucifer looked into the drawer himself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“No.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Do you
think Nadia took it with her?” Selene asked, worried by mostly unconcerned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“That’s
impossible. I saw to her departure, she left straight from the dorms rooms. If
she came back, someone would have seen her.” Alecto explained. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Then it’s
somewhere in here, just waiting to be found. It’ll let up. Time, however, will <i>not.</i>
We should drop by Team Blazer now if we want to do anything before class
begins.” A solemn but hopeful order from Lucifer had the entire cabin’s
residence jostling towards their neighbors. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You and
Beleth love to ham it up in this regard, but have you ever thought it necessary
to include me!? Never, not out of respect, but <b>fear!</b> So go ahead, throw
whatever you’ve got at me, It’ll only fuel my wrath!” Rade wheezed, entangling
his fingers with Lexy’s for an arm-wrestling challenge. Beleth simply laughed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I can’t
wait to see what happens next. If I tried something like that, she’d rip my head
off.” He jeered with excitement. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Err… A-Are
you sure you want me to try my hardest? I do this kind of thing a lot, and you
look kind of… <i>Frail.”</i> Lexy took a brisk peek at his supposedly atrophied
muscles. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Don’t try
to get out of this! I know you’re <b>afraid,</b> but that’s the point! Facing
that which terrified you most is the key to overcoming it. So if I <i>scare</i>
you, all you have to do is repent!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Fine. You
asked for it. One, two, three, go!” She started the test of strength. Not quite
on board with crushing him, but aware of her own modesty, Lexy decided to let
him struggle for a couple seconds. Beleth could only imagine her surprise when
Rade’s hand plummeted in the <i>wrong direction,</i> instantly signifying a surrender.
<i>W-What!? Did he just eliminate himself?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“…Damn.”</i>
Rade couldn’t believe it. He was petrified, frozen in shock, when a swarm of
knocks invaded. Beleth sailed up, opened the door, and then leapt back on the
bed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Arm-wrestling!?
And nobody invited me? Move over, <i>bag of bones!”</i> Alecto flipped a still
stunned Rade out of the way and took his place. He fell completely limp on the
floor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Really,
you’re going to challenge <i>me,</i> Alecto? You couldn’t even beat fiddle-boy <i>Beleth</i>
in a fight, what gives you the idea you can hold a candle to me?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                         </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hey!” The target
of ridicule couldn’t let Lexy’s fleeting jabs go unnoticed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Grr!</i>
Let’s have it then! One, two, three, go!” Alecto grabbed ahold of Lexy’s hand
and began the grappling-match. Every member of each respective team, despite
missing one each, rallied behind their contenders. The participants growled at
each other, struggling with no clear champ. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ah, I see.
My technique was all backwards.” Rade sat up and catalogued what was assumed to
be <i>notes</i> in the Fear Index. A sudden leap in stakes acted as the
culmination of their competition. Aggravated with the stalemate, Lexy pulled in
a way such that both her and the assailant were force onto their feet. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I don’t
think so, I’m not letting go!” Alecto jerked her hand back, flipping Lexy into
a somersault. She landed on her heels, also understanding that loosening their grip
would mean constitute forfeit. With that, both twisted each other into repeated

There’s been an alarming amount of grimm attacks in Forever Fall, and he was

idea to take it even <i>further.</i> We’ll make this a free day. How does that
sound?” Nobody said anything back. “…What, nothing? Fine, how about we write an
essay?” <i>That</i> finally garnered a response, albeit an adverse one. “That’s

keep it in check, where it won’t get lost again and force us on a retrieval
mission for the umpteenth time. If we’re extra lucky, it’ll get lost in this
void.” Lucifer waved his hand around the smoke. Alecto burst into another
tirade. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Nothing is
allowed in there you idiot, remember? There’s no entry for us, <i>that</i>
privilege goes to the skeletons.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Skeletons?
You’re telling me skeletons come out of there? If that’s true, you have some of
the greatest potential I’ve <i>seen</i> in a semblance. <i>Exquisite!</i> Show
me the skeletons.” Boreas declared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Your wish
is my command! Just let me concentrate… Aha!” She paused, closed her eyes,
tensed her hands, then put everything she could into assembling an apparition
without incentive. The wait may not have been worth it, as all that hovered
onto the ground was another bony hand. Boreas quickly assessed it for himself,
using a magnifying glass to inspect every detail, as trivial as it may seem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“A <i>hand. </i>A
hand, yeah?” He wasn’t very impressed, that was until it began articulating
itself. “What in the!?” It reached for his face, latched onto his arm, then
refused to let go. It took but a fraction of his strength to tear it away, but
just that much was a burdensome test. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It’s
moving!? H-How!?” Alecto clapped. “All that we’ve managed thus far was the odd
prone limb! I can’t believe it! I’ve never seen someone develop so quickly!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“And it’s
all thanks to you, Alecto. Thank you.” Lucifer offered her a handshake. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Really,
that’s it? A handshake? No hug?” She accepted his proposition but couldn’t
forego further insolence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I don’t hug
people, in case you haven’t noticed. Be grateful you got as much as you did.”
Right after condemning the act, he kneeled down to nuzzle Selene. “But
seriously, thank you.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yeah!
Without you, we would never have gotten this far!” Selene nodded. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I-It’s
nothing, really. Anything for you two. Don’t get ahead of yourselves though, a
hand is one thing. You’re still nowhere near combat ready.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The skeleton
fist slipped away from Boreas’s clutches onto the main table where Stam
normally sat. Penelope had dozed away again, completely ignorant of the recent
events, but the newcomer was more than willing to scare her back into the real
world in as rough a manner as necessary, its motives a pure mystery. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“H-huh?
Gah!” She reacted as anyone would have if a disembodied vestige of a hand
tapped their arm. Dreamcatchers didn’t generally act as weapons, but her staff
was styled as one, always nearby and now firmly in her grasp. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Don’t
worry, it’s from Selene’s semblance. I <i>think</i> it’s friendly.” Alecto
watched the topic of discussion scurry back to the floor and run circles around
Merlin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh. Creepy.
So her semblance is what, necromancy?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Come to
think of it, is there any evidence what, or who, you’re raising was alive at
some point? <i>Is</i> this manipulation of the dead?” Boreas pulled out a
pamphlet on the subject. He somehow had a tool for every job hidden in his many
coats. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Um…” Selene
met Lucifer’s eyes, and they both caught Merlin’s stare.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“There’s no
evidence of that.” He declared. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What do we
call this thing? Semblances usually have a name, but in the instance of a
summon-type ability, people like naming the spirit.” Boreas broached the
subject. “Her powers seem to be some sort of <i>necromancy</i> variant. Not quite,
if what you say is true, but we’re still dabbling in skeletons. No matter the
specifics, the warriors we’ll eventually call are the result of this power, a <i>Necrocyst,</i>
if you will.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“So, we’re
beckoning <i>Necrocysts?</i> That can’t be right, those are reserved for a
special someone in Kingdom Lore. How do you know about those?” Alecto wrapped
her head around his suggestion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I caught a
peek in Stam’s private library. You’re right, Necrocysts were a type of hoplite
that sacrificed themselves for an ancient king. But if Selene sticks to one individual,
it’s best that one gets a name to set it apart from the rest. I think it’s preferred
we do that. Start small, <i>then</i> maybe think about a dual ensorcell.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“How about
this. So as not to disrespect the <i>‘King,’ </i>we can name Selene’s guardian
Necrocyst but with a modifier, something unique to her. Like, <b>Royal Necrocyst,</b>
or something.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Royal
Necrocyst…</i> I like it!” Selene approved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I just had
an interesting thought.” Boreas put away all his equipment. “If we’re not
tapping into the dead, could this really be a gate to another location, or
something similar? I’d heard of semblances of that type, but never seen one
myself. I don’t believe this is a separate dimension, rather an unknown area in
Remnant that you’ve been tied to. Those books in the library made mention of
it. I’d once read up on a mythological figure who had access to an empty void,
and he used it to escape attacks.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’m
familiar. That guy could walk in and out himself, though. How are we supposed
to get this thing back in the portal?” Alecto redirected the discussion back to
training. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Let me
try.” Selene focused once again, and with some struggling the hand carried
itself by all five digits into its home and fell inside. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Wow, so
you’ve got some aspect of control over it. Great job! What do you say, Lucifer?
I think that milestone’s enough for today.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I guess so.
We’re free to go right, Professor Penelope?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Huh!?” She
jarred awake. “Oh, of course. You have been this entire time. Actually, since
you five are the only ones still here, and you’ve decided to spend your time
productively, how about some extra credit?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yes,
please!” Alecto saluted, chomping at the bit for more points and willing to do
anything to get them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You’ve got
it. Now, run along.” She closed her eyes to resume her nap. For her, peace was
always found in the pleasure of brief hibernations. But not everyone was able
to flank their problems by switching off, some could only flee. One such
student had long since ran away, and was now standing at the final threshold
between Vale and Mistral. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Nadia
extended her metal nails back and forth in an alternating pattern just to keep
herself busy. <i>Ten minutes past sundown,</i> she told herself. That was when
her train was scheduled to leave. She couldn’t stop watching the board with all
the times posted, nervous to make the final step and return home. How many
times she snuck a glimpse at the large display which she slowly began to hate
didn’t matter, it was this one that had her noticing the adjacent poster. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“The
Vytal Festival.” </i>She read it out then buried her face in her hands,
mumbling to herself<i>. “You were supposed to be a part of that, Nadia. You
were supposed to better. What are you doing?” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You could

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Who- <i>Stam!?”</i>
She couldn’t believe her eyes. “What are you doing here? How did you find me?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“This
happens to be only one of <i>two</i> stations that lead to Mistral’s <i>main</i>
travel ports, in which I believe you arrived, no? The other is lost to short
detour through Forever Fall, which is under heavy guard at this time. Do
correct me if I’m wrong, but this is the same train you took to reach Vale the <i>first</i>
time. The long journey from here to the Kingdom is arduous enough to take once,
let alone twice! Why <i>have</i> you left Beacon Academy?’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…I had a
big fight with my team, and I just didn’t feel welcome anymore. Lucifer was
bossing me around, and he made me feel… <i>worthless</i>. Maybe he didn’t mean
it, though. He said Team Lance weren’t my real friends.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Miss Flora,
we’ve all had disagreements with our allies. I can’t even begin to recount my
own. Believe me when I tell you that you have many awaiting your return, and
the meltdown between you and your captain was a <i>minor</i> setback, caused by
mounting tensions. In a way, your tactics are admirable! Mister Virtus heard
the message loud and clear, trust me on that one. I’d even say he’s ready to
change! And you know better than anything, Mister Virtus simply has a short
temper. It runs in his family.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Selene
never treated me like that, though.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Their
relationship is more complicated than you know. That’s something you need to
ask him about back at <i>Beacon.”</i> Stam fixed his hat. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Do you
think I overreacted? Even if I didn’t, I can’t go back now. I’ve been gone for
so long. How can I face my team after everything that happened?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“As they
will face you, with open arms. Without you, Team Lance will be unable to
compete in the Vytal Festival. I was personally looking forward to commentating
your rounds, as was Miss Penelope. It’s always been a pleasure for everyone
involved. Is there a more appropriate way to start the festival than with
Mistral and Atlas coming together?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Haha. And
Team Blazer was pretty fun, too. They’re probably as ashamed of me as I am. I
doubt they even realized I’m missing.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“The choice
is yours. I understand things seem pretty rough now, but one day, you’ll be
regretful you never took all the chances and opportunities given to you. Take
it from me. I spoke with Warden Augustus in Forever Fall, and he asked me as a

wants to know where you are.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’m sorry,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ho! There’s
no need to call me that, Miss Flora. If your days in Beacon Academy truly are
numbered, then I am your professor no more. Anyway, I should really be going!
The grimm aren’t going to be fighting themselves, are they? Just always
remember to keep your chin up, never stop smiling. It was my favorite thing
about you.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Thanks,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…Another
story for another time.” Stam took the first step back. “Oh, one other thing. I
thought it would be a waste to leave Vale after everything with nothing to
show, so Headmaster Ozpin helped me gather <i>this</i> for you.” He handed her
the missing chess piece from her dormitory. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Th-The

the memories trampled over her emotions. A shower of nostalgia, sentimentality,
and remorse washed over Nadia. She pulled back her hood and wiped away a stream
of tears. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Your team’s
been looking for you, by the way. They miss you.” Professor Stam hid his hands
in his pockets and tramped away. As he departed, the train took his place. Its
classic chugging and iconic horn popped Nadia out of her stupor. <i>It was now
or never.</i> She could leave to Mistral, back to a familiar world without
prior conflict, or venture from whence she’d come and reunite with every
acquaintance made in recent memory. </p>
