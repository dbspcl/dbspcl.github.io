<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                                                                                                                      </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You’re
asking <i>me</i> to come to Summit’s Blight with you, are you insane? Do you
have a death wish or something?” Lucifer broke off into another tangent. Some
chilly night-sky air might compliment the mood and calm him down, therefore
Alecto pushed open the window. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Cool down,
dude. Last time we went there, it wasn’t <i>that</i> bad. Sure the White Fang
showed up, but <i>we</i> attacked first. Just take a compass or a map. <i>Boom,</i>
I just solved all our problems.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Boom, you
just devised the worst strategy I’ve ever heard in my life. You’ve only been in
the Blight once. Selene and I tackled the mountains head on, and if you knew
what I knew, you wouldn’t be so headstrong on your own destruction.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Give me a
lesson on tactics then, sir. How do we leave Summit’s Blight?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You don’t.
There’s only one person who can. If we were to go inside, a bullhead is a must,
and every single one is dealing with the invasions at Forever Fall. Augustus
himself is likely there.” Lucifer checked his scroll in the event of an
emergency situation requiring their assistance. He surveyed the view, prepping
a hands on demonstration by pointing at the fragmented satellite above. “Do you
see that big ball up there?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You mean
the moon? Of course I can see it, the holes in this mask aren’t that small.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“The
sections of land shuffle themselves at all times based on the moon’s phases. I
was told this much by <i>‘Nomad.’</i> The freak somehow knows everything about
Summit’s Blight, if we go in then he’s our only hope. And I have reason to
believe he’s in the White Fang.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Not every
faunus is in the White Fang, you know.” Alecto came to the stranger’s defense,
sitting at a table loaded with school supplies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“If you saw
him, you wouldn’t be so idealistic. He’s got antlers, and his jacket, which can
somehow block bullets by the way, is covered in symbols reminiscent of the
White Fang.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hold up. He’s
got antlers, can traverse cursed areas of Remnant, and has a bunch of patterns
on a cloak that doubles as a shield? Draw the symbols, then.” He handed him a
pen and paper. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What?”
Lucifer reluctantly took the items. “Do I look like an artist?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Draw them.
A big guy with antlers navigated around land forsaken by- oh, never mind. Just do
it. You’re the one talking about it, you should be able to remember them.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Fine. A
majority of the design is just a bunch of these, but on the side is this big one.”
He drew several two-pronged lines, then an emblem resembling three pins with a
symbol on top. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Aha!”
Alecto swiped the page away in a hurry. “See? This is the symbol of- Oh!
N-Never mind.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I need to
teach this <i>entire</i> team how to lie. Clearly you recognized this. Spit it
out.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What’s
important is Nomad, whoever he is, is <i>not</i> in the White Fang. Trust me on
that.” She crumpled up the sketch and threw it in the trashcan with enough
speed to bypass Lucifer’s curiosity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Fine.
Explain to me this, though. Why are you so hell-bent on returning to Summit’s
Blight?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We’re going
to Summit’s Blight? Neat!” The door opened, and in Selene trotted. Merlin
surged into her arms, perking up at the sound of her voice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“No! Stop! Enough
of this nonsense. We’re not supposed to go back there, it’s too dangerous!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Well now
it’s two against one. That means power goes to us ladies.” Alecto tried to
fist-bump Selene, but all she received was a failed high-five. “Let’s go.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“No!” He reached
forward and pulled Selene back by the arm. “You’re not to enter Summit’s
Blight, you might get hurt! I won’t allow it! Why are you doing this, Alecto?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Let her go,
and I’ll tell you.” She bargained. Following a brief pause, he complied. “I
thought since Nadia was nowhere to be found, maybe she ended up lost in
Summit’s Blight. Who knows, maybe she’s still there now. Think about it, that’s
the only place we haven’t checked since she disappeared. If it turns out she’s
not there, then we’ll finally have closure and know she made it to Mistral
safely. We have to look there, Lucifer. You can’t stop me, and if you try, know
that’s the behavior that caused <i>her</i> to leave, too.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I… I, um.”
He was at a loss for words, unusually able to articulate anything worthwhile.
“Okay. Let’s get this over with. Does Selene <i>have</i> to come?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“There’s no
way you two are going to find Nadia without me! We’re a team, right?” She
crossed her arms to sulk. He nodded, accepting what was coming next. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Do you
think we should invite Blazer?” Alecto prematurely hit the door a few times.
Rade of all people opened it, and the mess inside answered her question before
anyone else could. Beleth seemed to be fencing an imaginary opponent with his
violin, Lexy was spinning around in Rade’s sleeping bag while the ceiling fan
was on the highest setting, <i>Rade</i> touted a paper bag over his head, and
Zara was coiled up in her own hooks, wrestling with the extendable pitchfork. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Greetings,
fellow knaves! What can I do for you?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…I don’t
want to know. Alecto closed the door in Rade’s face and looked at Lucifer in
bewilderment, expecting nothing short of what she got: a shrug. And with that,
all three left to the stormy clouds of the east. Never before had anyone from
Beacon entered Summit’s Blight under the guise of nightfall, and during a
particularly brutal storm no less. The road leading inside the amalgamation of
maze-like ravines, thunderous clouds, and perilous inclines did almost nothing
to ease their anxiety. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We don’t
have an umbrella, do we?” Selene shivered, sporting only the iconic dress to
fend off the elements. They weren’t even in the depths yet, only standing at
the border, and Lucifer was already being rained on with both water and second
guesses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Here.” He
unclipped his cape and draped it around her shoulders. “Pretty soon, I’m going
to run out of these.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Haha. You
could borrow some of Alecto’s. I hear you look good in purple.” She held Merlin
close to share body heat. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Not gonna
happen. Nobody wears my armor but me… Okay, fine. Here you go.” Alecto gave
Selene the same treatment, sheltering her with the beloved but partially
tattered piece of fabric. A rocket-locker lodged itself into a chunk of stone
nearby, a fortified capsule holding many of Lucifer’s assorted firearms and a
spare cape. It was commonplace to sacrifice them for the mission at this point.
Alecto called a locker as well, her golden scimitar more than necessary for the
challenges ahead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“W-Was that
thunder or grimm?” Selene referenced the barrage of indistinguishable
crackling, the sort that shook the heavens and instilled fear into the hearts
of trespassers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I can’t
tell. It echoes around here, making that sound last much longer than normal. My
guess, though? It’s lightning. It’s like a warzone up there.” Lucifer, in an
unusual ploy, had Selene go first. Defending from right behind, he could see
anything approaching. As for threats from the rear, they’d have to go through <i>him</i>
first. “Don’t let it get to you. With perseverance, and some <i>luck,</i> we
might get out of here without attracting too much grimm.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Selene broke
off to read a sign up ahead. “What does this say? ‘<i>Anti-Citadel,’</i> huh? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“This is
generally the first landmark found in here, at least in my experience. After
this, there’s no turning back. In fact, there’s usually a door down there. We
could escape this rain if we go underground. Practically anyone with half a
brain would do the same, so our chances of finding Nadia increase if we go
ahead with it.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Then let’s
do this.” Alecto wouldn’t use the staircase, understandably so. The steps were
concealed by loose gravel and wet dirt. So she sailed downward, surfing on the
mudslide by utilizing the slick metal armor provided. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I can’t
really do that. My dress will get all ruined.” Selene grimaced. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I gotcha. Hold
on, alright?” Lucifer put both his arms out. Selene fell back into his
encouraging cradle and the two met the edge, with her guardian lifting her far
above the bog of ooze and sludge. He veered down with the same procedure showed
off only a moment prior. She was let lowered as soon as Lucifer shook his feet
clean of mud.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“There’s
that gate. Still closed.”  Alecto pointed to the wooden door. Huge as ever,
somewhat fortified, and splintery in nature, it hadn’t changed a bit. Such
familiarity did not apply to the entire area, though. With the staircase taking
them between the gate and a huge pitfall terrible enough to have no visible
end, it didn’t take much to deduce the old tricks were back in play. Summit’s
Blight was changing more than usual this night. The natural coliseum was large
enough for Alecto to consider taking a breather, prepping a lengthy jog. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

accident. A relatively calm and silent pause acted as a lull, and then at long
last the Grand Gatekeeper arrived. Galathyn broke through the door, exploding
it into a hailstorm of makeshift projectiles, while also shattering pieces of
boulder everywhere. It was on Nomad in an instant, all of this taking place in
less than a second. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The titan of
a grimm plucked Nomad off the ground with hands big enough to enclose every
finger around him. Through the wails and flooding they fought, Nomad somehow

back towards the floor with fulfilled intention of cracking it. </p>

Nomad’s landing wasn’t an easy one, but he flipped onto his feet just in time
to intercept an ear-splintering screech. Team Lance covered their ears, never
coming as close to the beast as they were now. Nomad simply braved the
shockwaves, stared down Galathyn, and held the crossbow to his side. </p>

time to recover, and without waiting for approval it pivoted one of its six
pointed legs above Nomad, and by extension Team Lance. The job of defense fell
to the deer faunus. Everyone scattered, but <i>he</i> intercepted and upheld
the appendage. </p>

short as Nomad, not to mention with a stinger-tipped leg of unmatched size,
blasted into the floor nearby. Their quarrels were too fast paced for the
students to keep up with, as Nomad traded blows by flipping around it, using
incomprehensible fighting tactics, and withstanding further capture with every
attack. He was taking damage for sure, the question was whether or not he was <i>returning</i>
any of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Argh!”
Nomad shrieked as Galathyn snatched him out of the air with a grab far more absolute
than the last few. A crushing grip and devastating throw later, and Nomad was
out of the fight for now, smashed through a huge boulder whereupon he disengaged.
But it <i>may</i> have been worth it. Such power required Galathyn to clash his
hand against the floor and keep it there. Alecto rushed over and shoved her
blade through its palm. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Galathyn
exploded into a girthy scream and pulled back. Alecto tried with all her
willpower to hold onto the still-stuck sword, but with all the flailing she
couldn’t last long. Unfortunately for her, and contrary to Nomad, she wasn’t
thrown horizontally, but <i>vertically.</i> Lucifer saw her silhouette carve
itself into the clouds, tango with the grimm for an admittedly profound measure
of time, then get chucked to the ground. In spite of Galathyn’s attacks being
nothing but throws and stabs thus far, Lucifer couldn’t just sit there and
watch. </p>

feet with Alecto in Lucifer’s arms. He didn’t want to imagine the consequences
had he not intervened, as where Alecto laid there was now a huge leg of
Galathyn buried into the arena. </p>

flatter yourself. A <i>thanks</i> wouldn’t go amiss. <i>Hey!”</i> The two were
pushed aside by Nomad, who hurtled them away while charging at Galathyn. The
incoming roar only tested his patience, and soon enough he was skittering by
strikes and once again ascending the organic levels. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“This

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Alecto
cleared her throat. “I don’t think I need to explain why Galathyn beats Grover

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“W-We didn’t

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>He blinked,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Someone

yelled over the rain. Before an insult or demand from Alecto or Nomad could be conducted,
Galathyn threw in its own answer with a howl.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The two
elders of Team Lance plowed onward together, leaving Nomad and Selene in the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Still

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“No… I came
to Beacon Academy for that reason, even though I can’t do what Lucifer and
Alecto can. But they tell me my semblance has great potential! I’ve been trying

furthermore reluctant to accept the crossbow gifted forth. Her deliberation
didn’t last and she took it, once again relying on Nomad’s weapon to assist her
friends. It wouldn’t have been the first time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You wish to

into the air. His coat, referred to for the first time by name thanks to
Alecto, pivoted off his back around his open hand to then whirl away. It
settled over Selene. “I only wish that ambition, <b>not</b> <i>Idol’s Cloak,</i>
had the strength to keep you safe.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The new
brigade held well enough against the unsurmountable foe. Chunks of rock
substituted as perilous projectiles, a severe assault honorable enough to test
even Lucifer in strategy. Meanwhile Alecto slashed past any boulders tossed her
way and made it to the base of Galathyn with relative ease. Now she had to
ponder how to <i>scale</i> the thing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Sword
strikes, gunfire, and masterful hand-to-hand techniques wore the grimm down.

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Wait, what?

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“A battle of

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You did it!

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Alecto laid
her hands on her waist. <i>“Pshh,</i> I told you the Gatekeeper would be a

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“There’s no

scroll. Now would be the optimal time to return home. “Here’s hoping it gets
lost somewhere thanks to the maze-switching complementary of this place. Or,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You know as
well as anyone. She’d be fine. Galathyn never would have never even seen her. <i>We</i>
wouldn’t even see her. A grimm taking out the greatest rogue in Vale? Don’t
make me laugh.” Their celebration and immediate speculation gave Nomad the
perfect cover to disappear. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“If your
survival didn’t rely so much on my assistance, I’d leave now. Why did they come
back?”</i> He exhaled too quietly for anyone to hear, approaching the brink of
the Anti-Citadel’s abyss. His muttering seemed to satisfy no one but himself,
and it would have continued if not for a subtle movement seen out the corner of
his eye. Thoroughly separated from Team Lance, and partially due to his unusual
petrification, he was too slow to escape with no casualty. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Ah!”</i>
Selene felt a foreign force shove her to the ground. Nomad saved her from one
of Galathyn’s spikes, as its death was but a cruel illusion meant to pick off
one of the traducers. It worked. Nomad was impaled through the chest, his aura
completely demolished, and a sizable portion of the stinger was sticking
through the bandages visible under his suit. Fatal couldn’t even begin to
describe the injury, as Galathyn was sure to leave a gigantic hole through
Nomad’s body. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“N-Nomad!

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><b><i>“B-But…
V-Victory! It’s… It is my destiny!”</i></b> He exhaled, reaching forward with
one hand for somebody purely imaginary. His hand was shaking. Morbid, if
fascinating, his skin slithering into a cracked and darkened state. Galathyn
retracted his leg, and Nomad fell to the ground, finished. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Leave him!
He’s done for!” Lucifer wrenched Selene away by the wrist for a tactical
retreat, followed by a flustered Alecto. Galathyn rose, threw aside Nomad out
of spite, and gave chase slowly but surely- everyone knew there was no way out.

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What do we

Selene her sword and upgraded to the bisque glaive. Now armed to the teeth with
<i>two</i> capes, <i>Idol’s Cloak, Nomad’s crossbow,</i> and <i>Alecto’s short
sword,</i> Selene was capable of defending herself, and Lucifer knew it. Now
he, along with Alecto, could mount a counterattack without tending to her
wellbeing. <i>“C’mon! Let’s kill this thing once and for all!”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>A whirlwind
of firepower and steel did wonders, although keeping in mind the low number of

hidden library, but she was an expert in grimm history even without that
crutch. There was no time to second guess, she whistled to garner an audience.
It blared yet again and tried smacking Alecto, but a swift feign opened an

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The spastic

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Besides
penetrating the skin, all that Alecto had accomplished was reduce not only her
vision, but the vision of others. <i>A true stalemate.</i> That was the state
of affairs. A third entity would need to intervene and tip the odds for this
dispute to go any further. Fortunately, besides Galathyn and Nomad, the <i>last</i>
faction occupying Summit’s Blight was ready to make their move.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“What!?

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Y-You!?”</i>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“You’re

unprepared for Galathyn’s unnerving hollers and at this time unable to use his
semblance in the rain. It wasn’t all bad though, a battalion of his men climbed
onto the field, armed with the classic blaster and pointed knife.<i> “Gah!
There’s no time! <b>Fire!” </b></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Lucifer was
too enamored with the blaze of explosions and never ending volley of bullets to
notice an extra set of salvos join in. The black haze of blood didn’t help, but
once it was cleared everyone, Galathyn included, was better off. An immense
hand ripped Alecto away and mopped her across to ground <i>into</i> Lucifer.
The abuse knocked her out temporarily, and conclusively put the soldier into a
position fit to see Herald and a batch of grunts nearby Selene. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“No!”</i>
He sputtered. His blitz towards an unhinged Herald would have worked had
Galathyn not taken advantage of his tunnel vision. One of the barbed supports
drilled down, right onto him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I-I don’t

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ack! Our

direction, where Selene could see him facing certain death by poison. Galathyn brought
the hammer down, and if Nomad couldn’t tolerate it, <i>Lucifer</i> didn’t stand
a chance. He braced himself.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Lucifer!”</i>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Somebody
intercepted Galathyn’s jab, driving their weapon deep into the bone, causing it

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Huh?”
Lucifer looked through the slits formed by his fingers and blinked a few times.
He even had to retract his mask to make sure he was seeing right. Responsible
for halting Galathyn was a hooded assassin with needles strapped to her fingers
as weapons. “It cannot be!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Nadia!

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Y-Yeah,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Wha-who?
Nadia?” Alecto picked herself off the ground. Her recent blackout subsided at
the most opportune of times. Then she saw her old teammate back in the fray. <i>“Nadia!?
No way!” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“It’s
going to be alright<b>!” </b></i>She looked back at Lucifer with her old
signature grin, winking. The last reserves of her strongest venom would have
put any grimm before her to sleep, but all it administered to Galathyn was a
weak case of temporary paralysis. It would be back full force in just a few
moments. Lucifer said nothing, opting rather to shotgun a <i>hug.</i> “Ah! You
got all affectionate while I was gone! I guess all those kindness lessons
worked, huh?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Nadia. I’m

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“For

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Aw, c’mon
Lucifer! Friends fight all the time, it was nothing but a disagreement that

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Shut up. <i>Haha.”</i>
He chuckled, letting her go. Next it was Selene’s turn. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Nadia!” She
lifted her dress a bit to make running easier. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’d
recognize that cute little voice anywhere. <i>Ah!”</i> She kneeled down, but
didn’t expect a second huddle of tenderness. Nor a third from Merlin. Nobody
could resist petting him, certainly not her. “Wow. You guys went soft.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It must

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Don’t

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I promise.”
Nadia set a hand on Selene’s shoulder until an array of spiked fingers tapped
her own. She quickly turned to see a suit of armor stand proud. She’d nearly
forgotten what Alecto <i>looked</i> like. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“You
have… Absolutely… No idea… </i>How long we’ve been searching for you. And after
all this time…” Alecto growled in short burst, her tone quivering with fury.
But on a dime she shifted to pure joy and fell into Nadia’s arms. “You’re back!
Thank the god’s you’re back! We missed you so much!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“W-Wow. What

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Besides Team
Lance, there was a last associate not only willing to greet Nadia, but provide
an explanation- albeit this answer wasn’t sensible in the slightest. Galathyn
stomped with a cacophonous bellow. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’ll tell

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Let’s show everyone
what happens when a grimm challenges a Keraseer!” Alecto twirled her epee. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yeah! Team

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…I’m glad

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Herald
coasted over with every remaining lieutenant acting as backup. “Just say <i>when</i>,
and then I will say <i>when,</i> and then my men will know <i>when</i> to
fire!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>All of Team
Lance, finally reunited, and a garrison straight from the White Fang were now
sizing up against Galathyn. They collected themselves for a last rally against
the insurmountable Galathyn. One side would win soon and eradicate the other
for the rest of time. But as the preparations for this finale commenced, <i>Nomad’s
groaning</i> postponed it another minute. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“No… Ugh…
We are not… finished.”</i> Amazingly, he was still alive. Unconscious but

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Nomad!”

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“No.”
Lucifer stopped anyone from changing her mind. “She’s better as the backline

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Erm, uh,
s-so am I! Fire at will, brothers! Someone has to bring up the rear!” Herald
scrambled away out of fear, everyone assumed. The two watched over the dying
traveler and began discussions of rekindling his spirit. At long last, the
final battle hung over as ever-present as the storm clouds and the downpour
they created. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Galathyn
found itself temporarily outmatched by three gladiators and a bunny, each putting
on display the brilliant expanse of practice and teamwork acquired over their
training. Even Nadia, in her absence, had retained an impressive number of
techniques formed with her friends. The grimm had <i>no</i> friends, and was
forced to fight on its lonesome. Beacon had less formidable combatants, but
their potential for fighting ability skyrocketed with their number. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“How is it
still alive!?” Alecto couldn’t believe the amount of damage Galathyn could
sustain without slowing down. Her job was to clear the path below, hacking away
chunks of horrific flesh and slow maneuverability to crawl. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Why
won’t you die!?”</i> Team Lance’s leader had landed a critical advantage by
somehow using Galathyn’s momentum to launch onto the head. He grabbed one of
the horns and heaved. Not so much ripping and he did crack the horn off, he
tipped off the edge and jammed his newfound javelin into an unprotected portion
of Galathyn’s shoulder. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>A responding
attack might have been mustered if not for Nadia. “Haha! I didn’t realize how
much I missed the good ol’ days!” She was working with Merlin, both of them
taking extreme advantage of their mobility to chop around Galathyn’s body using
velocity perfect for stealth. They couldn’t be found. Consequently, every inch,
even its bony armor, was gashed with lacerations. But none of them would have
gotten this far without the support of the White Fang. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Wait… I

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What is he
talking about? What do you know about the symptoms of this poison?” Selene
flinched at the ferocity heard behind her. Herald was on his knees same as her,
examining the condition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Galathyn’s

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“This is

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Gotcha!</i>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“I… don’t

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What should

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I think,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Ah- Um,
I mean, err,</i> it just seems like he’s pretty durable<i>, heh heh…</i> I-I

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Wait… What

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Argh!
L-Listen to me, princess! Whatever smarts you think I have, forget about it! A truth
to a mystery that brings only anguish ought to <i>remain</i> a mystery!” Herald
said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What are

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…Some
things are best left buried, the past lost to time, never to be remembered. <i>Arghh!”</i>
Galathyn put a stop to this. In Selene and Herald’s distraction, it had somehow
grabbed ahold of <i>every available fighter</i> save for the White Fang. And
packing such a load, the colossus believed the next step was to bludgeon the
last vestiges of resistance with this bundle of hostiles. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Everyone
landed together, worse for wear, but Selene was thoroughly isolated by virtue
of her tail ended stance. Herald found no sanctuary, falling into the deep
confines of Summit’s Blight to an uncertain fate. Everyone else had been
knocked out of commission, completely exposed and more vulnerable than ever. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Galathyn had
had enough. One more excruciating screech, packed to the brim with as much
passion as possible, marked its need to cease the havoc. Two of the foremost
legs waned high into the air, lined up to form one gargantuan trident, and piled
on Team Lance without mercy. Lucifer, Alecto, Nadia, and Merlin realized escape
was hopeless, and shielded each other in desperation. The time had come for
Selene to act. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><br>
<i>“No! I am ordering you to <b>stop!”</b> </i>She shouted, holding her palm up

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The portal
characteristic of her semblance reverberated into existence among the clouds,
and from this nightmare realm Selene invoked <i>Royal Necrocyst.</i> A skeleton
hand, far bigger than the others, stretched its ossified fingers and locked all
five around Galathyn’s two descending halberds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Royal
Necrocyst!?</i> B-But how? This can’t be happening…” Lucifer spoke for
everyone. Royal yanked the contending limbs away from Team Lance, then winded
up a cataclysmic vise that connected without fail. Galathyn twisted backwards
into the entrance of the Anti-Citadel, suffering inhumane levels of damage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Based on the

proud of you!” Nadia cheered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Th-Thanks.”
Selene appeared exhausted, her call upon Royal taking a toll. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Are you
alright? Y-Your eyes, Selene. They’re <i>black.”</i> Lucifer upheld her chin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“They are?”
She blinked a few times, somehow oblivious to the changed pigment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Must be a
byproduct of her semblance. My eyes glow <i>extra</i> red, more so than they
already are, when I strain myself. It’ll pass.” Alecto calmed him down.
“Speaking of glowing red eyes, we should probably focus on Galathyn. Do you
think that thing’s still alive? I mean, did you see that punch?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“T’was
impressive, but I doubt that alone could end things. Case in point.” Lucifer
alerted every one of the approaching atrocity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ugh. How do
we kill it?” Nadia had a lot of catching up to do. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Nothing
works, and believe me, we’ve tried everything. All that’s left is to execute to
it a taste of its own poison.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Alecto added
in an important distinction. “I’d say we’ve evened the odds. I doubt Royal can
fully replace Nomad, but we’re about to find out. Remember, he died because <i>we</i>
weren’t paying attention. He was far too good to ever get hit like that on his
own. The idea that he’d sacrifice himself like that, it’s no wonder he works
alone.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I wouldn’t
say he’d dead <i>yet.”</i> Selene’s gaze wandered to his still twitching body,
but it was quickly drawn back to the war crying Galathyn. “Ah! What should I
do?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Tell your
new friend to attack!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Okay! Um,
R-Royal Necrocyst!” When Selene said it, the floating hand jolted at attention.
“I need you to kill Galathyn. Only the poison from its legs can do it!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Royal gave a
thumbs up and coasted as appointed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Are we
going to sit around and watch? I think not! <i>Charge!”</i> Alecto, rightly
overconfident now that they had a challenger of equal size, initiated another
into the no-mans-land of the Anti-Citadel, with only the skeletal sage hanging
behind to utter orders at Royal. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Hit ‘em!
Good job. Now, quick! Defensive measures!”</i> She didn’t need to make her
voice heard, somehow Royal could hear her even when taking on a war-crying
behemoth amidst thunder. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Ooh!
I-I’m back! No need to worry about me, I assure you! Bunch of ungrateful
brutes!”</i> The unmistakably scrawny voice of Herald travelled through the
wind. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You’re
okay?” Selene had to turn her concentration to him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Never
better, princess! I wish I could say the same about my fleet! Look at this.
There’s <i>nothing</i> left!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Sorry about
that. But look!” She pointed at the culmination of not only the last few minutes,
but her constant coaching. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…Today is
just full of surprises, isn’t it? Wait, what’s that? Look!” He creeped over to
Nomad’s crossbow. It was soaked in the rain and mud- not that it mattered.
Herald could operate it skillfully no matter the condition, contributing in his
own way. Even from a distance Royal’s brawl shook the heavens, but the much
needed killing blow was an impossibility. He needed more aid. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hya!”
Alecto and Lucifer took upon themselves the blind spot and helped each other
tackle Galathyn’s arms by vaulting one after the other, hands interlocked. Using
broadswords and combat knives, they pierced each extremity and used <i>weight</i>
to subdue those fearsome nails. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                                                                                                                                                                                            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Haha! Perfection!”
Nadia participated in tandem with Merlin in hopes of dealing with the back
legs. Royal could utilize the front ones. The bunny found solace in the joy of
bountiful leaps, dodging a flurry of stake jabs until it became too much. It
was then he landed in Nadia’s arms, and being the sly ace, she evaded each and
every thrust. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Once stamina
depleted itself, she exacted a devious move wherein she fabricated another duck
and kicked out Galathyn’s footing. Continuing the combo, Nadia pitched Merlin
across the terrain so he could do the same. Now with no arms or hind legs, a
calamitous attack was available to Royal. It was up to Selene to order it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Now! Destroy
it!” The phantom snared around the forward-most legs, fastened his grip, and tore
them clean off. One climactic clamor to bid farewell may have complemented the extra
typhoons of dark liquid spurting out of Galathyn’s stubs, but it was cut short.
<i>Royal skewered the spear through Galathyn’s chest.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Yes! If
you can bring it to the table, we can dish it back out! How does it feel!? That’ll
teach you to hurt our friends, you <b>disgusting</b> grimm!”</i> Alecto mocked,
falling back with everyone else.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“D-Did we
actually win?” Herald stuttered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Stay back!
It might have a reserve attack!” Lucifer had everyone take refuge behind him.
He couldn’t be more wrong. Galathyn staggered back, stiffened, and then fell
into one of the deeper chasms to its death. The Grand Gatekeeper was gone,
never again to plague Summit’s Blight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Can I go
home, now?” Nadia sighed, making light of the situation. Granted, she waited
until they were out of the woods to do so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Admit it,
you had fun.” Alecto giggled. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yeah, real
fun fighting to the brink of death, running around the literal worst area in
Remnant. And it’s all thanks to you.” Lucifer scoffed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It doesn’t
matter <i>I</i> brought us here, what matters is, I was right! Why are we here?
That’s right, your remembrance to solve that one!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…We’re here
to find Nadia. And it worked. Let me be the first to say, it’s great to have
you back.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It’s great
to be back, Team!” She reassured everyone with a peace sign. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ah!” Selene,
to the immediate alarm of Lucifer, toppled to her knees. Royal Necrocyst
departed, sinking into the hell born port which then evaporated. In accordance
with this, her eyes faded back to their pearl hue. “I’m fine, I really am. I
just need to get my energy back.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Hmm, hm
hmmm…”</i> a series of inaudible hums lurked just as well their owner. Herald
was hoping he could meander away undetected and resume his duties, but Nomad
would not allow it. His stream of idioms prevented Herald from forgetting his
presence, and the subsequent outburst cemented this. “Ah! My- Err, Nomad!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What should
we do? We can’t just leave him here?” Nadia prayed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What <i>can</i>
we do?” Lucifer crouched down as a pulse check was badly needed. “He’s still
alive. <i>Barely.” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“C’mon Nomad!
You can’t die on us now!” Selene tried to shake him out of the coma. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“You’ve
given me… everything… You gave me the greatest gift of all…”</i> He droned on. Nadia
fanned her needles over his head, seeing just how unconscious he really was. <i>No
reaction. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We need to
get him to a hospital. Standing around here won’t do anything. <i>Augustus
Correctional!</i> They have an infirmary there! It’s his best shot.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’m open to
carrying him out of here, but I think you all may have forgot something.”
Lucifer hoisted the body onto his shoulder. “We are stuck in Remnant’s biggest
maze. We’re like rats down here.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Well, erm, <b>I</b>
may know how to get out.” Herald sheepishly admitted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You.”
Lucifer stood eye to eye with the General. On account of their size difference,
even with his hat Herald barely matched half the height of the aggressor. He
gulped. “You actually helped us. You know, Nadia, I’ve been thinking for a
while about this. Maybe the White Fang isn’t <i>all</i> bad, after all. <i>You</i>
seem tolerable at least, as irritating as you are.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Alright! I
didn’t think you were capable of changing!” Nadia playfully wrapped her arms
around his neck. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Not so fast!
I still have my reservations about the White Fang, but <i>Herald</i> here gets
a pass for now. Move, before I change my mind.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Herald
tapped his fingers together, fidgety as always. “Eh, well, actually, I’m not in
the-”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Silence.
What did I just say? Are you braindead? <i>Move!”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Nghhhh!
Okay, just please! Don’t hurt me!” Herald flexed his gloves while guiding Team
Lance out of Summit’s Blight. His method was eerily similar to Nomad’s, as ridged
and confined as looking up at the moon and examining each and every rock
formation <i>could</i> be. Into the Anti-Citadel’s mine, up a manmade
staircase, through a gorge, and around a hillside they went. Rinse and repeat a
few times, and it was done.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“There,
there, you’re good to go. See, Vale is right in that direction!” Herald pointed
west.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Thanks for
your help, Herald.” Selene said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Um, it’s
fine. I don’t need your thanks. And don’t worry about me. I’d come see to it
that Nomad is healed myself, but alas. My job here is not done. The rain may
give in, but I cannot.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What are
you doing in Summit’s Blight, anyway? You’re not after the Relics, are you?”
Selene brought forth her knowledge gained in the library alongside Boreas. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Relics!?
No, no, nothing like that!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Aha, so you
do know what they are!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ack! Noo!
You <i>rascal!</i> Fine, I know of the Relics. But I don’t care! By command of
my Lord, I cannot tell you what I and my forces are doing here. But I can tell
you what we <i>aren’t</i> doing.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><br>
<i>“Lord?”</i> Alecto repeated. “There’s only <b>one</b> of those, and I don’t
think you’re a Keraseer. What’re you talking about, what <i>Lord? What’s going
on here?”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You’ve got
to tell us something! What is so important within Summit’s Blight?” Selene
frowned. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…I’m sorry.
As I say, some things are best left buried. Till next time, princess!” Herald
ran back into the silver peaks. Nobody dared race after him, afraid of getting
lost again. And if Nomad didn’t find treatment soon, his demise would persist
all the more. Fortunately, while Herald’s trail was at an end, <i>Nadia</i> had
braved the path to the prison many times, and knew the perfect route. She
picked up where he left off. The Warden pursued was not far off from his
hospital, busy with his own mission. A repository of files and mugshots were
under heavy scrutiny, but even the pursuit of a peculiar criminal could be put
on hold to welcome back his old friend. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Augustus!
We need your help!” Nadia found him fast. He was difficult to miss. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Nadia!?</i>
I thought you’d be in Mistral right now, least that’s what you told me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Absolutely
not! I’m staying here in Vale, where I belong.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh, you
have no idea how glad I am to hear that. I made it out of Forever Fall with all
limbs intact- well, the ones that are left, anyway. And now I come back and
find <i>you?</i> Could this day get any better? A guy like me doesn’t feel
happiness that often, you were among the few who could change that. You still
are!” He pat her shoulder. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Thanks, but
we have a problem! Our friend here is dying!” To make her point, Lucifer held
the limp form of Nomad forward. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Damn.</i>
What happened to him?” Augustus used his semblance to levitate Nomad onto a
stretcher. He glided with purpose, everyone else having to run if they wanted
to keep up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“He got hit by
Galathyn, a poisonous grimm. He’s been in this state for a while. I still can’t
believe he survived <i>this</i> far.” Alecto explained. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I see. Here,
we’ll take him where he needs to be. Get this faunus medical attention, now.” He
pushed the gurney to a line of emergency nurses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Is he going
to be alright?” Selene asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I can’t say

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Nomad. At
least, that’s what we call him. We don’t know much about him, but he’s a faunus
from Summit’s Blight.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Once he
wakes up, <i>if</i> he wakes up, I’ll figure everything out. I’d check the
records for him now, but in his condition I doubt anything would come up. So
many people meet their end in this place. Quick note: I’ve been running the
scans on that rifle collected from Servus Portum. I can’t thank you enough, we
now have a solid understanding of Servus-engineering. And it’s been confirmed.
Caligula is providing criminals with guns. The next step is to bring in an
authority to rival him, and I already have a good idea on who that’ll be, but
never mind that. I’m just happy you’re back, Nadia.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“N-Nadia?” A
timid tone accompanied the stature of a hologram. The outsider met her best

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Um, who is

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh, that’s

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ah, Ella.
This is the colleague I’ve heard so much about. It’s good to meet you, Ella. Nadia,
you didn’t tell me she was from Atlas.”  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I-I’m not.”
Ella sheepishly admitted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Really? My
apologies, I just assumed because of, you know, the techno look.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“That’s just
the way I am.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Nadia
assumed her defense. “There’s a lot we don’t know about her, same as Nomad.
That seems to be a reoccurring theme around here. Ella’s got a minor memory
problem, she can’t remember anything that happened before I met her. But believe
me, she’s really sweet and nice once you get to know her!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I really
like your dress!” Selene smiled. “Oh, that reminds me, here’s your capes back.
And I’ve still got Nomad’s jacket. Could you return it to him, Augustus?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“How
interesting. This belonged to Nomad, did it?” He accepted the overcoat. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yep! I
think Herald still has his crossbow, though. Nomad should be able to get it
back pretty easily once he’s cured. I don’t think Herald is really that
threatening to him. Or <i>anyone,</i> really. I mean, the White Fang scares me,
but <i>he</i> doesn’t seem that bad.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Lucifer
tightened the straps around his forearms. “He’s a scoundrel for sure. A slippery,
slimy, scheming little freak. But he did help us. Can’t fault him there. Ha. If
you told me when we first met that I’d be sitting pretty with the White Fang
here and now, I’d probably laugh at you.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“You?
Laughing?</i> That’s a rare occurrence.” Alecto solicited a chuckle from Nadia.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh, I
almost forgot how much I liked these antics! Get her, Lucifer!” Team Lance and
the inhabitants of Augustus Correctional conversed all in good fun. The quirks,
quibbles, jokes, and squabbles were just as enjoyable as Nadia remembered. It
was then she decided she had made the right choice in not only choosing Beacon
Academy, but <i>staying</i> there. “Anyway, Ella, you’re still in Sector Two-One-Four
right?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yes.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We should
probably go settle down there, then.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><br>
“What?” Alecto stopped her right there. “You’re not coming back to Beacon with
us? I can’t wait to see the look on Team Blazer’s face when they see you back
where you belong, with your team!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Sorry. I
just fought the strongest grimm in Remnant after hiking from the harbors to
Summit’s Blight, and it’s really late. I’m dead tired actually, and I’m
guessing everyone in Beacon is winding down as well… But I <i>would</i> want to
talk to them again.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“C’mon, I
bet Team Blazer isn’t anywhere near asleep! They’re probably playing games right
now, as we speak.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Okay, okay.
Ella, I’ll be back tomorrow. I really need to get some sleep.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“O-Okay! Just
seeing you today, and being able to talk to you again was the best time ever.
See you all tomorrow!” She waved everyone goodbye. On their trek back, as they
crossed the tremendous bridge holding the institution to the continent, Lucifer
removed Nadia from the group to speak in private. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Nadia? I
have a question.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                                                                                                                                                                    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Of course.
What is it?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“When we
fought, you said you hated me. I just-”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I could
never hate you, Lucifer! You’re my friend! I shouldn’t have said that to you.
My mistake.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Well, I shouldn’t
have pushed you to that point. I guess we’re both sorry, then. But there was
one other thing I was wondering. There’s more to the friendship between you and
Ella than you’re letting on, isn’t there?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What makes
you say that?” Nadia couldn’t look him in the eye. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Your appearance.
You two are wearing similar robes. Your capes have the same emblems on them,
the same design seen on <i>Idol’s Cloak-</i> the jacket worn by Nomad. And the
tip of your hoods are marked with the same symbol. You claim she can’t remember
anything. Did you know her in the past, and you’re not telling anyone?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“N-No! I
can’t. It’s nothing, I’m serious.” Her words came out muddled. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Come to
think of it, he’s right. You two <i>were</i> wearing the same thing. What is it
about her? I thought your hoods were unique, custom made for you alone.” Selene
joined in. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It is! We’re
just… <i>Ugh!”</i> Nadia collapsed to the floor and covered her eyes in shame.
Everyone hurried to make sure she was alright. “Can I really tell you guys the
truth? I just got you back, I don’t want to lose everything again…” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You can
tell us anything. We’ll be there for you.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Okay. I
trust you.” Nadia took a deep breath. “I am an <i>Amaryllis.</i> That means I
live by a religion lead by a Goddess named <i>Hestia.</i> We share her
bloodline as <i>Descendants.</i> There are many customs to this practice, like
my uniform, but that’s not important right now. The main element of my
Amaryllis heritage is the Soulcess. Every one of us Descendants knows of it,
we’ve all come to respect it.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Soulcess?”
Selene grimaced at the word. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“To the
Amaryllis, it’s the required practice that leads to believed reincarnation.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Life
after death?”</i> Lucifer couldn’t believe what he was hearing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yes. It
requires a sacrifice to work. As my religion dictates, I must participate and depart
into the Soulcess. It comes for every Amaryllis at the age of thirty…” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“So, you
have to die when you’re thirty?” Selene choked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Not die.
There’s no telling what happens when I cross the threshold, but I won’t be <i>here</i>
anymore. My time in Remnant will have come to a close.” Nobody spoke for what
Nadia estimated to be ten whole seconds. Taking in the story was no easy feat,
but what she feared most of all was the incoming reaction. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…Alright.
That means we get something like thirteen more years guaranteed with you.
Better make it last.” Lucifer held his hand out, waiting to help her up. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What? You
guys aren’t mad at me? I-I’m sorry I didn’t say anything earlier, I just didn’t
want you guys to leave me. Anytime I’d ever told anyone about this, they
abandoned me before <i>I</i> could abandon them, when Soulcess comes. But it’s
something I must do.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Mad? Why
would we be mad? Truth be told, I already knew about that.” Alecto teased. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You did?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yeah. We
Keraseers know all about religion. Goddess Hestia herself was a skilled champion
in the Old Arts, in which we live by. Listen, Nadia, we’re not going to beat
you up for this. It certainly couldn’t have been easy for you, withholding
something like this this- but the sooner you told us, the better. Even still, you’re
crazy if you think we’re gonna leave you behind. Nothing will <i>ever</i> drive
us apart again.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“So, if
you’re an <i>Amaryllis,</i> does that mean Ella is, too? Is that why you
befriended her?” Selene chirped. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yes. Maybe
it’s her semblance, but because of whatever condition she has, she doesn’t age.
And she doesn’t remember anything about herself. Therefore, she would be the
friend that <i>always</i> stood by my side, never needing to achieve Soulcess
but always understanding. I guess that extends to you guys at this point,
though. I’m so grateful everything’s out on the table now.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Lucifer
looked at Selene, hesitant to respond. “Exactly. There are no more secrets
between us. C’mon. Beacon Academy awaits.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh, I
forgot! Were you guys missing this?” In her capote relaxed the Black Knight
chess piece. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“So you <i>do</i>
have it! Aha!” Alecto asserted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yep! Isn’t
it strange how, even at night time, it shines? I guess it must be the
moonlight, or something. If you’re wondering, it’s a really long story how I
ended up with it, actually. I’d be happy to tell it once I get some sleep. You’ve
got the other knight, right? It’s about time they rejoined. It’s just not the
same without both, you know?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…Affirmative.
To the Black Knights.” Lucifer boasted, not only reclaiming the memento but
wreaking one last embrace onto everyone. So it was that Team Lance came
together not just as teammates, but treasured companions they could confide to.
It would be prudent for Lucifer, Alecto, Nadia, and Selene to cherish the time
they all held each other dear. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Perhaps our
heroes were in fact ready for the dangers that came with being Huntsmen and
Huntresses. It’d be foolish to believe that this was the last of the threats
Remnant had thrown at them, but maybe there was a chance those journeys could
be bested as well. Whether or not these brave young souls would come out unscathed
is another tale entirely. </p>
