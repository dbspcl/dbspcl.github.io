<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center'><i>Entry 7: <span style='color:#806000'>To the Mellow’s
Depths</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“W-Who are
you?” Selene hopped back at the sight of a forgotten peer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What? It’s
me. You know, <i>Terrance.</i> I’m in your class.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh. What
are you doing here?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Just
looking for someone.” He scanned the environment, although considering the size
of the dorm room there wasn’t much to miss. The closet, however, proved
enticing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Alecto
joined into the calamity without even knowing it, walking out of the wardrobe
and steadying her sword at the sight of a stranger. “Who are you?!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’m <i>Terrance!</i>
Does no one seriously remember me!? And as I said, I’m on the prowl for
somebody missing.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…It’s not
me, is it?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Unfortunately
for me, not right now. Just an old accomplice of mine. But ever since that unfair
victory I’ve been waiting to get even.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What are
you talking about?” She asked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“The
sparring match. Between you and I. You cheated.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh, right.
I probably forgot because it was such a cake walk.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><b><i>“Gargh!</i></b><i>
You haven’t a clue who you’re talking to-“ </i>Terrance broke out in another
insane outburst, looking completely unhinged until a glimpse at Selene reminded
him he was in public. He switched back to his standard self. “Aha. I mean, it’s
clear there’s nobody here! Till next time!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Terrance
scurried through the front door into an uncharitable and unmoving Lucifer.
Without any need for further conversation, the rabbit faunus trotted around him
just the same. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Who was
that?” He asked. The pair shrugged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Terrance.
Claimed he was looking for someone, then insinuated he had a bone to pick with
me. Not that I care, mind you. <i>I’ve</i> always got my back, <i>you’ve</i>
always got my back, and if that fails we’ve always got Nadia…” Alecto spoke too
soon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…She’ll
come back. Right?” Selene assured. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It’s been
too long. Maybe she’s just testing us. Otherwise, maybe she really did leave.”
Lucifer didn’t know how to soften the blow, but he had a saving grace. “She’s
from Mistral, is she not? Sources point to a settlement in that direction, led
by a patron of the Kingdom no less. If she wanted to spend a couple nights anywhere,
she’d be <i>there.” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“So you’re
suggesting Nadia’s hiding out in a village to the east?” Alecto sought further
clarification. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Affirmative.”
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Okay. You
wouldn’t be telling us this if you didn’t have an open schedule. Let’s get
going. And when we get there, you’re going to apologize, <i>affirmative?” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We’ll see.”
Lucifer opened the door for his two teammates, launching the search for the
third. A few strides and they were already stopped, the stampede of four
friends breaking into the hallway and nearly toppling them over. Rade, Zara,
Beleth, and Lexy all piled outward in that order. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Move!” Zara
in particular broke away, apparently having been dragged into the conflict
against her will. Selene noted she was clearly sleeping a moment prior,
clutching her sheets. A greater mystery was <i>how</i> she ended up a part of
the pandemonium when her bed was out of the crossfire, <i>outside. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Nothing to
be afraid of folks! But hey, don’t let me stop you!” Rade squirmed away as
well, but rather than retreating back inside he took refuge behind Team Lance
and scribbled a quick paragraph into the Fear Index. The final two charged down
the hallway, Lexy brandishing an ornate violin and Beleth gaining ground to
reclaim it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Do I even
want to know?” Alecto finished face-palming. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You’ll give
me questions, I’ll give you answers! For a <i>fee.</i> Knowledge for
knowledge!” Rade bowed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                                                                                                                    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You’re
right. I <i>don’t</i> want to know. But if you’re offering, we’re looking for
Nadia. You didn’t see her, did you? What am I saying? Of course you didn’t. <i>I</i>
was the last one to see her.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Are fears
all you keep in that book?” Lucifer inquired. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yep. But I
keep plenty more up here.” Rade pointed to his forehead. “Fire away!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We’re going
to a city state awaiting to the east, and I don’t know why you would, but maybe
you know something. I’ve heard the ruler’s from Mistral. My research also leads
me to believe it’s a town in the sky.” Lucifer filled him in, but the last
detail caught everyone’s attention, most notably Selene’s. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“The sky?
Who’d ever heard of a town in the sky?-“ </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Mellow
Crest!?” Rade piped up. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“That’s
right. You’re familiar?” Lucifer crossed his arms, impressed with the
scarecrow’s insight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“All too
much. And that’s right, it does rest in the skies, although it’s hardly a
simple town! You’d be a fool, although not unfounded, to believe you could
reach Mellow Crest without a ship. The only path up on foot is to climb on
these big chains that burrow deep into Remnant! If you’ve got a sharp tool like
this pitchfork, it becomes second nature with practice!” Rade’s already
overflowed movements sparked with extra excitement. “If I wasn’t so busy, I’d
really venture to tag along! Maybe next time, heh heh.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“This is a
personal mission anyway. But you have my thanks. Anything else we should know?”
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Nadda!</i>
But do me a solid, please. If you run into Mellow Crest’s Baroness, tell her I
said hello.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“If we see
her, we will.” Alecto felt it was due to him in return for the help. Nothing of
any real consequence stopped them after that, safe for a bushel of meadows and
lengthy rocky inclines. At one point the flashes of lightning over a gray
cluster of cliffs got Alecto’s attention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Wouldn’t we
need to pass through Summit’s Blight to reach Mistral?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We’re not
going to Mistral, remember? It’s a branch thereof. While the Blight takes up a
great hemisphere of Sanus and holds both the detestable <i>White Fang</i> along
with, <i>ahem,</i> <b>other</b> individuals, Mellow Crest is well out of its reach-
<i>north</i> of the mountains.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You <i>really</i>
don’t like the White Fang, do you?” Alecto interrogated, not realizing the
shivers she inflicted upon Selene with the mention of their name. “There’s a
prominent group in Remnant’s history known as the Old Fang, but experience
shows they’re not the same. What is it about them that’s so terrible? They just
seem like a militia group to me.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I find the
issue trivial, although as evident from our current circumstances not everyone
agrees. All <i>I’ve</i> ever known of the White Fang is misery. Clearly Nadia’s
seen this so-called <i>other</i> side of the coin. I’m still not convinced it
exists.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“They target
humans, least that’s what I’ve been told, and more or less experienced myself.
My only run in with them was our first adventure in Summit’s Blight, but were
we faunus would the White Fang have stopped us? I don’t recall them mentioning
anything about humans.” Alecto said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Are you
likening what we’ve faced to a splinter group? Say what you will, at most
everyone agrees the White Fang commits great transgressions against humans. If
you’re somehow suggesting <i>‘Herald’</i> and his men weren’t among them, some
evidence would go a long way for me.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Selene cut
in. “I didn’t know Nadia felt so strongly about this. I didn’t know <i>anyone</i>
could. The… White Fang, to me and Lucifer, is the cause of a terrible war our
lands endured. I thought here there’d be less here, but…” She paused, losing
her train of thought. Merlin skittered into her arms for mutual comfort. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’m just
saying, as an outsider the only vibe I got from them was a need to protect their
territory. I’d probably be more on board with you if <i>Nadia</i> wasn’t
playing the other side.” Alecto reasoned. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“That won’t
last if we don’t find her.” Lucifer got them back on track just in time to see
the now iconic trio of chains. Snuggled amidst a glorious valley caked with
roses, sun flowers, and perfect grass were the three massive strings of chain
links, currently entombed from the clouds into the feat of nature. Each one
formulated a broad triangle in accordance with the domain’s edges, although
they all reconvened in the center, fading into the white puffs. The perimeter
of the landscape was sealed with waterfalls and cliffs, although none reached
this sky-fortress. A fair few waterfalls cascaded from the kingdom itself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Woah…” Selene
and Merlin alike, and not to the contrast of her other friends, were
justifiably impressed with the spectacle. Even the peaks of the city’s
structures were a thing to marvel at despite being barely visible. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Finally. No
killer forests, maze mountains, or police states. Just a nice, safe haven.”
Alecto let out a long winded sigh as well. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’m hoping
you’re right. Let’s get in there and find out.” Lucifer set an example by
galloping down the fields. Without needing any command, Alecto bound onto the
first metal link, gaining purchase with her blade. Each piece of chain was many
times bigger than herself, and falling brought a real risk of tumbling into the
craters which housed the footholds. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Lucifer
followed the smart strategy with the use of a combat knife, but his free hand was
available to be held out. Selene paused, gulped, and then followed his signal.
She jumped over the relatively small hole, and Lucifer took care of the rest.
He grabbed her hand and guided her onto his back with one slick movement. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hold on,
right? Just like we practiced.” He appointed, grabbing ahold of his cape and
tossing it around to envelop Selene. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Right. You
know I’ve never been scared of heights, silly!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Although
they were technically trespassing, Mellow Crest didn’t seem to mind. Especially
upon entering the City of Tears, it was clear Team Lance was more than welcome.
Certainly it was an odd sight to see four travelers crawl over the chains into
the center of the urban dominion, but as long as they didn’t present a threat
nobody challenged it. Visitors were common after all, and seldom cast away. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Where do we
start? This place is really pretty! No wonder Nadia would hide out here.”
Selene dusted off her dress. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We could
just start asking the civilians.” Alecto raised her mask, comprehending the
unlikely chance of a combat situation in as serene a province as this one. They
took to her suggestion, tolerating the strange but understandable glances or pauses
that came forth when someone was questioned. “Does this place actually get much
traffic? As we’ve seen it’s sort of… off the beaten path, shall we say?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“As Rade
said, the use of a bullhead, or dropship would help. Or, perhaps it’s an
isolated state. We made it up here without much contention from neither the
elements nor the populous. Do you really think that’s an anomaly?” Lucifer
ranted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It could
be, how am I supposed to know?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh, look!
Maybe he knows!” Selene pointed at a familiar face down the road. He couldn’t
be missed, with his sheets of leather and tendency to release a macabre ambience
wherever he stood. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Boreas!?”
Lucifer repeated himself upon reaching the junction. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hmm? Ah,
Team Lance. Well, most of them, anyway. How did you find Mellow Crest?” Team
Burnt’s leader only drew his eyes off the Beryl Rhinestone for a moment, but
soon payed full respect by addressing his friends in full. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Pretty much
for that reason. We were hoping Nadia was here. Did you see her?” Alecto
answered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Unfortunately
no. Still missing, is she? A real shame indeed. But you’ll find her, if anyone
could it’s you three.” His response prompted Merlin to stomp his feet in a
tizzy. “Four, rather. Excuse me, as you’ve broached I’m here on research
affairs. Baroness <i>Miku,</i> I was hoping, would have some insight into the
Rhinestone’s connection with Summit’s Blight. I was mistaken.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Miku?</i>
Who’s that?” Selene said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It must be
this ruler we’ve heard so much about.” Lucifer caught on quickly. “Where is
she?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’d ran
into her at the Clock Tower. You’ll find it’s easily seen.” He raised his hand
to the heavens, pointing out the tallest spire. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Got it.”
Everyone but the alchemist migrated to the Clock Tower. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We’d stay
and chat, but we’re on a mission. Sorry.” Alecto stayed behind to pat Boreas on
the shoulder. Although considering his height, she couldn’t quite reach. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Don’t be.
We’re all caught up in work these days, myself included. Go. Find Nadia, and
when you do, make it clear we’re <i>all</i> waiting for her return.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Alecto
nodded and ran to catch up with the caravan. A series of detours revealed how
lost she really was. <i>H-How did I lose them!?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Contrary to
the bristling positivity and high energy provided by the city, grimm <i>were</i>
here. They had somehow seeped through the cracks of defense, allowed to fester out
of public view to create admittedly low numbers. No real threat for the knight,
rather a nuisance. She was excited to put grimm of any type or number in their
place more so than anyone else in Mellow Crest. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>A sprinkle
of young grimm were far too easy. Taking advantage of the sanctuary and
intelligence that came with old age, a moderately powerful boarbatusk swept
itself into the brawl with full intent to do away with the invader.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’ve never
seen a clock tower double as a <i>bell tower.</i> Where are all the mechanical
parts?” Selene was occupied with the real task at hand, now waiting in the landmark
with everyone but Alecto. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“The plaque
here says there <i>are</i> no internals, that somehow the clock is kept in
motion by command of the Baroness. The same could be said of the entire city.
How poetic. She keeps both time <i>and</i> space in order.” Lucifer summarized
the text.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“She’s
really powerful enough to keep Mellow Crest floating in the air? What about
when she’s sleeping?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’m not
sure. More puzzling is the idea of her citizens moderating <i>themselves.</i>
Is she the only enforcer here?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>A complete
stranger intervened. “Well, sort of. The denizens here are no different from
those in Mistral, or Vale for that matter. They’re good people, and they
understand that with protections and compassion, contentment must be traded.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“So there’s
no police. But there <i>is</i> an entity willing to drop everyone at the first

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Quite the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“I?</i>
You’re the Baroness!?” Nothing ever slipped past Lucifer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Please,
call my Skyler. It’s a pleasure to formerly meet you! You’re from Atlas, are
you not?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Affirmative.”
He shook her hand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“And you
must be?” Skyler leaned down, smiling. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Miss Selene
Virtus!” She giggled. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Selene <i>Virtus.</i>
Ah, I see. It’s an honor to meet you <i>both. </i>Did anyone else come with
you?”        </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The double
doors made way as Alecto, along with her polar opposite, barged inside without
regard for the inhabitants or their architecture. Seeing as it was her only
option, her sword was jammed in the armored back of the boarbatusk, and without
any way to control it, the grimm was headed straight at Skyler. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>‘Gah!”
Alecto and her sword lost their hold on the steed and flew through the air into
the wall. The boarbatusk was forced to halt, Skyler taking matter into her own
hands. An arcane staff warped into her hand. Making use of such a tool allowed
her to freeze, levitate, and lob the foe out the front door. Casting boarbatusks
out of her domain seemed effortless as long as she wielded the
constellation-riddled cane. “S-Sorry!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Woah! Where
did you get that?” Selene buzzed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I made it. It
took me awhile though, wanna see? There’s a great story to go with it,
actually. Remind me to tell you sometime. Surely you didn’t come to Mellow
Crest just to hear me talk about myself, right? What business do you have here?”
She passed her weapon down to the teenager. While Selene was busy examining the
artifact, her pals revealed the details of their quest. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We’re
looking for a young girl named Nadia. She always wears a blue hood and cape.
You’d know her if you saw her. Only problem is… you wouldn’t see her.” Lucifer
began to realize how difficult it was to find the ultimate rogue in a haystack
the size of Vale, let alone Remnant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Why’s that?
Has she gone missing?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Well, sort
of. She knows exactly where she is, I hope. Cause she didn’t get lost, she
just… <i>ran away.”</i> Alecto said, glaring at Lucifer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ugh. We’re <i>never</i>
going to find her. If she doesn’t want to be found, she <i>won’t</i> be found.
She could be five feet in front of us, and we wouldn’t know.” He deplored. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“This
Nadia’s pretty stealthy, is she? Where did she learn that from?” Skyler
reclaimed her wooden scepter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I can only
assume she was trained in Mistral, but she’s been our teammate from Beacon
Academy as long as I’ve known her.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You’re from
Beacon!? M-My apologies, it just seemed to me you lot were more… I-I thought
you were from <i>Atlas.” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We enrolled
awhile back to learn how to fight, and kill those big scary monsters!” Selene
puffed her cheeks. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Now you’re
talkin’ my language.” Alecto laughed. Skyler herself couldn’t help a few
gleeful chuckles. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“If you’re
from Beacon, that means you may have met-“ </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“W-What’s
that orange storm over there?” Selene felt it necessary to inject herself in
the conversation. It was clear what she was referring to, although it wasn’t as
much a storm as it looked like one. In truth, the distant atmosphere was so
polluted that the sky itself had turned gray and red. Amidst the smog that
settled among the clouds were a few silhouettes of skyscrapers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’ve been
wondering that myself. Only in the past week or so has it appeared.” Skyler
looked to the stars in thought. The bloody speck over the mountains was so far
she didn’t realize the gravity of its presence. <br>
<br>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What?! <i>Is
that…?”</i> Alecto put the pieces together, having visited the nation once
herself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Servus
Portum!?” Lucifer gasped. There was no mistaking it. The slow moving walls, the
Kingdoms turning their backs, soldiers investigating Summit’s Blight, and Caligula’s
promises of purification- It all made sense now. Servus Portum was ever
expanding. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Servus
Portum.” Skyler repeated, processing the name. “Should I be worried? My strict
apologies, as an isolationist I care little for the affairs of fellow
neighbors.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“This one’s a
tyrant with a lust for despotism. If he inches closer, I <i>would</i> be
concerned. That mystical polearm inspires confidence, but can it take on a
whole armada, and double the number of comrades?” Lucifer didn’t feel like
lying just to make her feel better. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It’s not
going to get to that point. I’ll speak to Servus Portum’s Ruler if he falls
over the hills. The grasslands of Mellow Crest have remained untouched for a
very long time. I’d very much appreciate if it stayed that way.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Their<i>
‘Supreme Leader’ </i>is not open to negotiations, I’m afraid. Fortunately,
you’ve got plenty of time to change his mind.” Lucifer was well-versed in the whims
of war. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’m a
people person, and I’ve been a prized diplomat for a very long time. I’m sure I
can reach him. I’m more concerned about your friend truth be told. She didn’t
go <i>there,</i> did she?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Not a
chance.” Alecto scoffed. “Nadia’s too good to get snuffed out by <i>them.</i>
No, if anything could catch her off guard, it’d be surprise grimm. <i>Hmph,</i>
as if. Good riddance to any disgusting creature who tries.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We better
find her quick, then. She’s not here, but if she pops up, I’ll tell her you
guys are looking for her. If Mellow Crest didn’t need me, I’d take her to
Beacon myself…” Skyler looked away, a sad innocence filling the air. “Maybe at
some point you four could hold the fort for me. I’d love to travel to Vale’s
Academy sometime.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Once we find
Nadia, we can all come back here! She would love to meet you.” Selene consoled.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Leave now,
and there’s a better chance that’ll happen. We should get back on track.”
Lucifer would have preferred staying, but they weren’t in Mellow Crest to take
a holiday. If Nadia wasn’t here, there wasn’t any real reason for them to be
either. “I can’t think of anywhere she’d be, though.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Maybe we
could check a few smaller towns on the way back. Do you think she could already
be gone?” Selene felt a great weight in asking such a thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“No.”
Lucifer left it that, setting an example by trampling out of the historic
settlement and towards midtown, where the binding chains were locked. Skyler
waved bye as everyone else did the same. The way back was a mystery to Alecto
thanks to her strange grimm-filled route. A garden with a clear view of Remnant
dared to be the only distraction, especially since Boreas had set up shop in
the botanical attraction. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“No luck, I
take it? We’re <i>both</i> stuck in a bind then. I’d finally get some accurate
measurements if Summit’s Blight ceased these roars. The vibrations, shockingly,
can be felt from here, and they’re tampering with my calculations. The Beryl
Rhinestone <i>must</i> be stable for this to work, and with every shout it
becomes more unruly.” Boreas figured Nadia would be with them at this point if
she was found. Most of his attention was on a nearby golden telescope marred
with trinkets and levers. Sitting in a hopper and jolting this way and that
awaited the gem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Haven’t
found a clue on this thing yet, have you? What makes you think it’s so
powerful? My lien’s on it being a ridiculous waste of time.” Lucifer said. At
hearing this, the Rhinestone ripped itself out of the cage and rapidly rolled
away. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“No! Get
that <b>Stone!”</b></i> Boreas screamed, watching it prance past everyone.
Alecto, not familiar with its power, lunged for it nonetheless just to land
hard without gaining anything. Selene wasn’t up to chase, let alone jump, but
Merlin picked up the slack. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>While
everyone ran but failed to catch up, Merlin was right on the Rhinestone’s
heels. Their race endured winding roads, twisting bridges, and several
shortcuts through rivers. Onlookers were mortified at the sight of a battalion
of armed contenders charging down a bunny, who was in turn charging down a
purple pearl. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Finally
Merlin caught it. All he had to do was spring out of Mellow Crest and slide
down the trail of chains with as little grace as possible. Everyone but Boreas
followed as he believed anything more than <i>four</i> runners a recipe for
failure. Skyler, privy to everything taking place in her sanctum, joined him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“How
exciting! I couldn’t be more pleased to see the antics of Beacon so
contagiously well-spirited.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“If the
Rhinestone wasn’t so integral to solving Remnant, I’d be more at ease with it
hanging in the balance.” Boreas stroked his chin. “It has a will of its own,
reacts to the shrieks of grimm, holds an unmatched sense of power, and I’ve
been told it can open seals within Summit’s Blight.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Really?
Can’t say I blame you for being so enamored with it, then. Go get ‘em.” Skyler
smirked. Boreas did as commanded. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Merlin! Are
you okay?” Selene, upon being released from Lucifer, scanned the tall grass.
She knew her friend could survive a fall even if he missed the landing, the
question was where he <i>was,</i> or if the Rhinestone did anything to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Merlin.
Where are you!?” Lucifer repeated her chant, but with his own militant tone.
Fearing the possibility of an assault, Alecto assumed a defensive posture. The
panic didn’t appear to be well-founded. Merlin, Rhinestone in paw, jumped high
into the sunlight and landed in Selene’s arms. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Gotcha!”
She hugged him intimately. The stone whipped itself out of their grasp right
into Boreas’s hand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Excellent
work. I should bring <i>Merlin</i> with me on my travels, he captures this
thing better than anyone else.” He admired. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Well, there
might be <i>one</i> other who has us beat.” Selene turned to Summit’s Blight,
smiling nervously. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Okay. We’re
done in Mellow Crest, and we’ve got your little toy.” Lucifer groaned. “We
should be heading back, now.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“If you keep
insulting it, you won’t just have <i>me</i> to deal with. You’ve already seen
the kind of havoc the Rhinestone can inflict.” With every order of business now
at an end, Boreas and Lucifer lead the party as team leaders. The trip back was
as demanding now as it was in reverse. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Now, you’ve
gotten better, there’s no question. These portals don’t seem nearly as taxing
as they were when we started, right?” Alecto coached. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Right.”
Selene was once again partaking in a session of semblance training. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“See? You
can even talk while doing it!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hey! No
fair! You’ve had your semblance for a lot longer than I have!” Her earnest
outburst was all in good fun. “I wish I could turn things into little balls and
hit them!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I wouldn’t
say that. We haven’t even <i>begun</i> to tap into the potential of your
semblance, and I’m guessing it’s going to be a real winner once we’re done.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Can you use
your semblance on <i>people?” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Sure.
That’s what it’s meant for. There’s only so many chairs I can slice in two,
y’know?” Alecto spun her beloved short sword, taking solace in its presence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Can you
trap enemies in the globe for as long as you want?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“They’ll
break out themselves, eventually. I’m not sure what it’s like- I’ve never used
it on <i>myself.</i> It might be a force of will issue. Maybe… I could test it
on <i>you.”</i> Alecto made a subtle move, looking to the ceiling directly at a
baroque light fixture. Something changed her mind. “N-Never mind. Bad idea.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You’re
right! We need to get to work, we’ve been sitting here talking too much.”
Selene caressed her braids. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Not at all!
Notice, this entire time <i>you’ve kept this portal going.</i> Keep it up, the
more we stretch and sustain your skill the better you’ll get. It’s like a
muscle, only we can’t <i>pull</i> this one. Now, if only we could get something
<i>out</i> of this portal.” The hellish doorway being referred to was, as
usual, a horizontal void filled with whirling lavender clouds. It formed a
limitless hole in the floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Watch out!
You might fall in!” Selene cried out. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We’ll see.
Something tells me…” Alecto reached forward into the gate to confirm her clawed
gloves could not breach the mists. A mythical force kept anything from mixing
inside. “Aha! Nothing is allowed in there. I probably <i>can’t</i> fall in, but
if I did, would it act like a trampoline or a pool?” Alecto finally posed a
question to Selene. She succeeded greatly in distracting the young empress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hmmm…” She
considered the possibilities while, directly above her, a force unknown cut the
cords holding one of the many lamp fixtures. Lucifer, with the help of a
durable lantern, crashed down mere feet from her location. <b><i>“Ahh!” </i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>In her panic
and sudden sense of danger, she tensed on reaction, and from a portal a single <i>skeletal
arm</i> was levitated into the air. It landed with a bony crunch. Every dry,
skinless finger stayed connected despite no evidence of ligaments. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Really!?
A skeleton hand?”</i> Alecto picked it up in disbelief. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“L-Lucifer!?
What’s the big idea?” Selene shrieked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I-I’m
sorry!” He couldn’t help but laugh, retracting his mask. “Please, forgive me.
You were never in any real danger, I had complete control. Trust me.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Guys? Look
at this.” Alecto approached with the terrifying appendage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Were you <i>waiting</i>
up there to scare me? <i>Why? </i>Are you crazy?” Selene seemed to be berating
him out of embarrassment at this point more so than genuine distress. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Alecto and
I thought you were ready to step it up. After so many tries at this, she was
convinced that, as long as you could maintain the portal, a little fear would
prompt an impulsive response. That’s how <i>she</i> learned.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Guys! You
won’t believe this!” Alecto tried again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“S-So you
two set me up thinking that if you almost dropped a light on me, I’d magically
summon a beast or something?” Selene squawked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It didn’t <i>almost</i>
drop on you- I made sure of that. You know I would <b>never</b> do anything to
harm you.” He justified. Alecto gave up, waving the spectral arm in front of
him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hello!?
Look!” She patted his chest with it a few times to his disgust. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“What the
devil!?</i> Where did you get that thing!?” He swatted it away. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Selene
summoned it, airhead. Our plan worked!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“W-What!?”
Lucifer was twice as shocked as he looked a few seconds prior. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Me? I</i>
summoned a <i>skeleton hand?”</i> The thought produced a combo of freight and
excitement. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yep! Want
to take a look?” Alecto held the limb down for a sort of gruesome peace
offering. Selene paused, completely entranced with the bones. Even Merlin
tilted his head, happy for her. It was amusing how such a grisly, mundane
object could produce such awe. Then, without warning, Selene snatched it away
and bolted out of the training hall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“…Yay! I
summoned a skeleton hand! I summoned a skeleton hand!”</i> She chanted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We… should
really go take that thing away from her before she gets in trouble.” Alecto
brought up a reasonable proposal. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…Affirmative.”
The soldier, his teammate, and the pet bunny broke into a sprint. Their new
task was to reel in Selene, and prep her for greater milestones. A dead, static
fragment of a skeleton <i>had</i> to be the beginning of something greater. It
was her burden to better advance these powers. </p>
