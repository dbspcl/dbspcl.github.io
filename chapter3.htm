text-align:center'><i><span style='color:#806000'>Moonlit Terror of
the Haunted Holiday</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                                                                                                                         </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The
shattered moon did a fine job of illuminating Vale’s roads, although the
streetlamps were adequate enough. Night had fallen upon the kingdom, dwindling
the number of active civilians. Their <i>guardians</i> were never absent,
though. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Pretty
funny how we’re the first to get these textbooks, you know?” Zara smirked,
although Lucifer didn’t see anything <i>funny</i> about it, all things
considered. “I wish they were available earlier, though. Maybe then we wouldn’t
be here this late just to skip tomorrow’s mob.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I have my
team to blame for that, and I’m guessing you have yours. My memories fail me-
what are they called?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Team <i>Blazer.”</i>
She admitted. “You should meet them sometime. Team Lance might be one of the more
<i>unconventional</i> teams, but in that area I think they might have you beat.
Half of them forced me to come here, and I don’t even <i>know</i> where the
last one is. You?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                                   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Nadia had personal
business. The others wanted some extra sleep, so I offered.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You’re not
tired?” Zara yawned. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Negative.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Guess that
means we’re <i>both</i> nocturnal, huh?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You don’t
know the half of it.” They retrieved the textbooks from Beacon’s library then
sat down at one of the exterior tables to survey the inventory. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Isn’t it
cool how we get the bundle free as long as we have our library cards? This <i>‘Textbook
Set Number 1’</i> better have everything though, otherwise it’ll sour the
cake.” Zara sorted through her four sets. “Wait a second, this batch is missing
one. Do you have all yours?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’ve got
everything.” Lucifer took a seat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ugh. Guess
I have to go complain, now.” She marched away with her bags. Lucifer sighed,
checking his scroll. <i>Nothing. Good. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                                 </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>He knew
somebody was approaching him- their squishy footsteps while quiet to anyone
else, pierced his hearing. A glance over showed cased something more horrifying
than anything he’d encountered since his time in Beacon began, <i>period.</i> The
freak was malnourished but tall, sporting the clothes of a dummy, and holding a
wide smile that would have seemed more appropriate on a <i>jack-o-lantern.</i> Lucifer
had seen him a few times in Stam’s class, but opted to ignore the antics to
spare himself the madness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“You seem
like an odd little fellow!” </i>The apparition noted Lucifer’s short-lived but
potent reputation. <i>“How could anyone think you’re scarier than <b>me?”</b></i><b>
</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You’ve got
the wrong guy. Move on.” He grunted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“No, no, no!
You’re in my classes, and with such mystery clouding you, <i>I</i> wanted the
privilege of breaking the ice! What’s your name?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hmph.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“<i>’Hmph?’</i>
Well that’s a scary name! Mine is Rade!” The degenerate conjured up a thick
book with strange symbols on it. The withered pages were swung to a blank sheet
without command. Rade scribbled in the fake name with a quill pen. “And just
for my own curiosity, for such a foe surrounded by fear, you must have a few of
your own! What <i>are</i> you afraid of?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Conversation.
Now <i>leave.”</i> Lucifer rolled his eyes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Tsk, tsk,
tsk! I don’t think that’s right.” Rade shook his head and tapped on the page in
an exaggerated display. “Try, try again!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Leave,
leave</i> again.” Lucifer’s patience wasn’t very plentiful. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“If you
insist.” The book warped out of existence and Rade skipped into the shadow.
Lucifer watched his silhouette fade, then looked forward. Rade was sitting in
the chair opposite to his. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“How did
you-“ </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ooh! Is
that a journal begging for your greatest fears, or are you just happy to see
me?” Rade cackled. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Lucifer
looked down, the world atlas-sized book staring him in the eye. Lucifer grabbed
the pen and finally cracked, writing down <i>an</i> answer. He slid the book
back. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>‘Go
away.’</i> Was written next to <i>‘Hmph.’ </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Fiddle-sticks!
Now I can’t use this page!” Rade ripped it out and slithered next to the
unwilling applicant. “You’re not a very happy camper, are you? Your mask must
have a few screws loose!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Listen to
me!” Lucifer wrenched Rade face-to-face by the noose around his shriveled neck.
“You have nothing to gain by staying here, and plenty to lose! I welcome it!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hohoo!
Don’t be so <i>daft!”</i> The creep breathed into Lucifer’s metallic face, spouting
green fog forth. He shuffled back a few feet, seemingly stunned. Rade took the
opportunity to pull out his <i>extendable pitchfork.</i> Having thrown in the
towel and gone forward with full offensive intent, he whacked his enemy with it
rather than used the prongs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Dargh!”
Lucifer swung forward towards what he perceived to be the fork’s source, but
met nothing. Rade had already swooped around, and struck him again. The charade
continued for a couple more hits until Lucifer was able to dodge around Rade’s
disorienting dance and get ahold of him. One brutal punch did a number on the
fear-inducing maniac, but there was more treachery to come. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>A jack-in-the-box
flew from a staggered Rade onto the floor and opened without even playing the
iconic tune fit for such a device. A caricature of its owner bobbed forth,
somehow <i>stunning</i> Lucifer. Considering his expertise and military-tech, a
flashbang wouldn’t have been affective in the slightest. Against all odds <i>this</i>
was. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Rade whipped
Lucifer upside the head with his armament and proceeded forth with a series of
nimble kicks. Lucifer could take a little more than a beating though, and
despite some considerate blows to his aura he was undeterred. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>He grabbed
Rade by his swinging leg and chucked him straight into the ground. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ack! That…
caused <i>pain!”</i> Rade convulsed in all directions. It was hard to tell if
he was really in trouble, or if he was putting on a show. Lucifer didn’t care,
he brought down the wild card’s own pitchfork around the neck, alongside the
noose. It didn’t cause any real damage, the pikes missing Rade, but it did lock
him in place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Willing to
play nice now?” Lucifer threatened. Rade’s chortles never left, it only grew
more plentiful. He wasn’t even close to finished, already having a plan to turn
the tides. But the fight was diffused before he got the chance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“What are
you doing!?” Zara dropped her textbooks. <i>“L-Lucifer!” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Stay back,
Zara! This scoundrel was at my throat!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“No! He
attacked first!” Rade laughed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Stop, get
off him! That’s my <i>teammate!”</i> Zara bolted over. She took charge of the
pitchfork and tugged it out of the ground. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Teammate!? <i>What?”</i>
He was speechless. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Eck!” Rade
groaned, hopping up and stretching. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Rade, are
you okay?” Zara patted him on the shoulder. “What are you doing here? If you
were going to show up anyway, you could have helped me with the books!
Something tells me you’re at least partially to blame for this.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“M-My
apologies. I had no idea.” The sounds of regret seemed foreign coming out of
Lucifer’s mouth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Sorry? For
what? I was having <i>fun!</i> The thrill of battle is almost as great as the
thrill of a <i>scare!”</i> Rade did a spastic jig. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“So we’re on
good terms?” Lucifer crossed his arms. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I hold no
grudges!” Rade had the sense not to ask about fears, at least for now.
“Sometime I ought to get a fair <i>rematch,</i> though! I’m looking forward to
it!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“In your
dreams.” Lucifer began a slow jog back to Beacon Academy’s dorm rooms, the
textbooks in hand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“No dreams!
Only nightmares!” Rade looked around and crept deep into the night’s shade.
Even if Lucifer hadn’t given in on his fears, there were plenty of <i>other</i>
students not as adamant to hold their cards so close to their chest. “Catch you
later!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You too.
Try to be back before midnight.” Zara picked up her own bags and ran to catch
up with Lucifer. Their sparse conversation was mundane, especially in the wake
of the recent mishaps. Getting back to their rooms was number one priority, as
the recent incident reminded them of Vale’s tendency to bring a bump in the
night. Rade wasn’t even the worst of it, Nadia was about to learn <i>that</i>
first hand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The edge of
Vale was mostly devoid of any light save for the occasional lantern. After
seeing this fact, Nadia had an idea that was ultimately proven correct. As long
night was upon her, the sky bordering the ocean would deepen further into
darkness and show even more stars than usual. Their luminescence was sprinkled
throughout, creating a deluge of beauty few would appreciate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The Huntress-trainee
leaned on the fence of the peer, smiling in contentment and almost meditating
to the view. She was displeased to hear a blemish on the wave’s echo, the horn
of a ship docking. <i>A cruise ship?</i> At this late hour, a luxurious yacht
was unexpected. Perhaps they were simply off schedule. A shadowy figure left
the exit-gates and moseyed down the wooden dock. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Missy?</i>
Surely a lass such as yourself would be better suited <i>indoors</i> at this
late hour, no?” The man chuckled, balancing against the plank-barrier and
striking conversation. He was dressed as the ideal tourist, all the way down to
his tropical shirt and shorts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I… Uh, I’m from
Beacon Academy. I can handle myself.” She considered the interloper harmless,
but was unused to small talk with absolute strangers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“That’s none
other than the combat school, am I right? My sincere apologies, I’m new to
Vale.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“No, that’s
right!” Nadia nodded. “Welcome to our kingdom! You’ll love it here, it’s not
like the others.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“I’m
counting on it.</i> The name’s Dimitri.” His grin was unreasonably wide, and
his hollow eyes didn’t help. But if Nadia had judged people on appearance
alone, her teammates wouldn’t have stood a chance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Nadia.” She
beamed back. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I was
wondering, <i>Nadia,</i> if you could do me the littlest favor!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“S-Sure,
what is it?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Could you
catch a snapshot of me in front of the waves?” Dimitri unwrapped his camera
from around his neck and held it forward.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Sure.” His
task required her to take several steps back. He leaned both arms on the
railing and smiled at the lens. After the job was done, she handed it back to
him. “Is that good?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I couldn’t
ask for anything more. <i>Till next time!”</i> He patted her on the back,
enjoying how well framed the shot was, before drifting away towards the promise
land. Nadia bowed to resume her star-watching session. His crooning could be
heard even as he approached the wharf’s gate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Stop right there!”
One of two cops charged into the scene to apprehend the tourist. “You are under
arrest! Get down, now!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Gentlemen,
you’ve got the wrong guy! I’m just out on vacation!” Dimitri spat out an
earnest attempt at reasoning, pointing at his camera as if it was somehow
proof. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Silence!
You thought you could get away just by leaving Mistral?” One of them approached
with handcuffs at the ready. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You got me,
I surrender!” He held both his hands up. One of the policemen held a baton at
the ready, the other proceeded to pull his arms down. They could only get one
cuff locked onto his wrist before resistance arrived. His voice, when shouting,
had a frighteningly affective pierce to it. <i>“Not a chance! <b>Laid off!”</b>
</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Dimitri
elbowed the deputy positioned behind, meaning to take full advantage of the stupor
that followed. A slick attack that more resembled a karate technique threw the
lawman overhead, into the ocean below. With half his enemies already gone,
Dimitri was sitting pretty. The other cop was dealt with as efficiently as the
first, only instead of the sea he found resolve further down the docks. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“I hope
your kind come back, lest we find solace in the peace of a great <b>holiday!”</b>
</i>Dimitri summoned an <i>extendable crowbar</i> and got ready to strike true.
Someone <i>unseen</i> halted his swing. “What!?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Nadia
needn’t say anything, her intentions more than clear. She glared up at him with
fierce eyes, blocking his swung with her needles. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“A hero?
Oho, you’re going to be <b>spectacular.”</b></i> His lips stretched ear to ear.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The fight
began as any would, a game of back and forth that ended in a tie. Nadia was
swift, faster than most, but her edge was lost in a one on one engagement.
Dimitri had no shortage of tricks nor practice, using the crowbar like a sword
when convenient or a club when needed. Although Nadia’s agility allowed her to
get a few shots in, there wasn’t enough time to inject venom, and Dimitri’s
aura seemed endless. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Take <i>that!”</i>
Dimitri blindsided her with a metal right hook, then followed up with a barrage
of hits that threw Nadia off balance. Punctuating the combo was a hammer-like
whirl that nailed Nadia. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ah!” She
gasped, turning invisible to evade his wrath. While Dimitri loved his
one-liners and wit, she put full focus on the fight. It rewarded her well. Finally,
she got a few rakes in, but her opposition was stronger than the average grimm.
More venom would be needed to subdue him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“You’ve
got me <b>fired</b> up!” </i>A twirl of steel followed the laugh, blocking
further incursions. Their choreography was admirable, even more so how Dimitri
could keep up with Nadia despite her insistence to go invisible after every stalemate.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Eventually
Dimitri’s <i>apparel</i> got in the way. The floor was smooth from the water’s outbreak,
and he could find no pity on the slippery bridge thanks to his fur slippers. A
number of planks split under his weight. Amidst a stroke of pure genius, or
perhaps mindless idiocy, Dimitri used one to shield himself. The four pins
impaled the wood, sticking through to the other side. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Anyone for
kebobs?” Dimitri twisted the makeshift talisman and pulled, forcing Nadia over
him onto <i>her</i> back. The two sprinted to their feet and clashed with their
chosen weapons. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Enough
of this!”</i> Nadia huffed out, making a potentially foolish move. She broke
the staring contest and attempted a calculated stab with her gauntlet. This was
a particular favorite of hers, it had brought an uneasy death to many foes
before. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>All her
speed and finesse did nothing. Dimitri had her beat with a ruthless parry. She
was both physically and mentally dazed at his ensuing onslaught. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The criminal
ended the fight by spinning his crowbar forth and latching the hooked portion
onto Nadia’s shoulder, whirling her onto her back. She had aura to spare, but
Dimitri wasn’t having it. His slipper locked Nadia’s equipped arm to the
ground. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“G-Get
off! How dare you!”</i> She struggled to get free with her other hand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Vale’s new
inhabitant considered saying something but decided against it when several floodlights
targeted him. He was once again intercepted by the police, only there were far
more this time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Stay right
there with your hands up! You are under arrest by command of <i>Augustus
Correctional Facility!”</i> A bullhead’s loudspeaker shouted him down. Several
cops set their reticles on him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                                                                                         </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Correctional!?
Hohoo, they don’t know what they’re in for!” </i>Dimitri crouched down and
laughed in Nadia’s face. <i>“It’d be no fun to end you now. Stay in touch!”</i>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>He did as
commanded, throwing in the towel. His captors advanced with care to avoid the
last failure that had befallen the police force. For all the tension building,
it was almost disappointing to see Dimitri <i>let</i> them put the chains on
this time. The only defiance displayed was merely verbal. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Are you
alright?” One of the cops gave Nadia a hand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I-I guess.”
She had to get her breath back. “He’s dangerous, you know.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We <i>know.</i>
The guy’s been wanted in both Mistral <i>and</i> Vacuo.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“That bad,
huh? I… I should probably go with you, then.” She craned her neck around,
recovering from the ordeal. As long as her aura wasn’t depleted, she was
willing do her duty. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“If you
insist. Hey, we could use a testimony, actually. Even been to <i>Augustus

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh, um… I
can’t say that I have. I hope it’s nicer than it sounds.” Nadia simpered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“As long as
you’re on our side, I’d say it is.” The police ensured her. She followed the
crew into the nearest squad car and drove off towards the so called Augustus
Correctional Facility. She couldn’t have possibly known she was headed to one
of the most expansive prisons Sanus had to offer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The
treatment center was home to a varied army of scum Remnant had spawned, but its
titular <b>owner</b> was nowhere to be found. <i>Augustus</i> probably could
have been a great ally in detaining Dimitri, if he wasn’t occupied on the other
side of town with personal affairs.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>It seemed
this particular segment of Vale was enjoying a light rainstorm, thus leaks of
water enjoyed sifting into the alleyways of the suburbs. It wouldn’t be long
before such a phenomenon took over the entire kingdom. <i>The man</i> didn’t
mind. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Warden! You
there?” The distorted cries of his subordinates crawled out of his coat,
courtesy of the walkie talkie shoved inside. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’m here.”
Augustus’s voice was shrill but kind. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“We just caught
word, a commotion at the western dock’s been stopped. Suspect has been
apprehended.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’ll be
there soon.” He confirmed. There was further work to be done. Grimm attacks
were growing ever more common in the region of Vale bordering Forever Fall. The
warden had little intention of entering the red forest at this time, but
scouting the streets nearby was a trivial matter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>There was
nothing to be found, the only annoyance remained the rain. Augustus could see
the gate leading into Forever Fall was sealed off by a lone Huntsmen. Whatever
grimm <i>he’d</i> slain were long gone, lost to the wind. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Has
anything changed?” He floated over to the guardian, his hands in his coat
pockets. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Nothing.
The grimm numbers haven’t gone up, but they haven’t gone <i>down,</i> either.
The recent spike hasn’t swayed, suggesting foul play.” Stam filled him in,
cracking his knuckles. “I take it you’ve looked into the matter? We don’t know
who, or <i>what</i> is causing this yet, right? If we did, we wouldn’t be here
now.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                                                                                                                                                           </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I can’t say
for sure, but we have an idea.” Augustus fixed his glasses. “I’d stay here with
you, we may even be able to go inside, but I’m needed at the prison. When it
comes to sources, Dimitri knows almost everything a man <i>could</i> know about
Remnant’s secrets. Least, that’s what I’ve been told.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“As
civilians bed down, their thoughts recede, and the negativity resides. I’ll
probably leave here myself in a matter of minutes. Let’s just hope this is the
worst of it.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“If you ever
need help, ring me.” Augustus wallowed away, his jacket struggling to unfurl
under the weight of the water. If he was right about his hunches, there weren’t
any reason to believe the grimm would subside. There wasn’t any point in
telling Stam <i>that,</i> though. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                                                                                                                                                                           </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Augustus was
recognizable as the Warden of the very facility named after him, but not to the
ignorant eyes of the general public. Thus his habit to travel through the night
was emboldened by the lack of citizens. A shortcut between two buildings would
prove beneficial, however. It was this route that led him right to somebody in
need. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Hello? Are
you there?” He swiveled around at the sound of crying. Staring him in the shades
was a <i>young girl,</i> wearing mystical robes and sporting a visual condition
Augustus had never seen. Light radiated off of her digital physique. He
couldn’t be blamed for assuming the ghost to be a <i>projection,</i> some
result of Atlesian technology. “A hologram?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“W-Who
are you?”</i> The girl stuttered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’m the
Warden of Augustus Correctional.” He glided over to her and crouched down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“W-What’s
that?”</i> A permanent stream of tears locked itself onto her face, almost
stuck in a stasis. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It’s a
prison here in Vale. What’s your name?” He tried smiling to comfort her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I-It’s

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“That’s
right. Are you lost?” Augustus proceeded to state his name. She nodded. One
would assume her to be afraid of somebody as frankly <i>terrifying</i> as him,
but she herself was a real specimen. It’s as if they were waging a competition
to see who could be the bigger outcast. “You’re blue. I can’t say I’ve seen a
specimen such as you… But I’m interested to see if the <i>Administrator</i>
has. Let’s get you back with your family.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“F-Family?”</i>
Ella paused, then followed against her judgment, realizing he was her only hope
for relief. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yeah,
family. You got one, right?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'> “I... I-I
can’t remember.” Her tear streaks grew more prominent. His expression changed
to one of sadness as well. “We’re going to get you home.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Home…” She
struggled to keep up with his pace. It was then that she noticed the blade
strapped to his back fall off. It had a mechanical constitution with electrical
components visible, and a bronze coil for a handle. And in falling to the
floor, its impact was masked by the hailstorm. “O-Oh! You dropped this!” Ella
scrambled to pick up the scimitar by the handle. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Augustus
turned and watched her <i>attempt</i> to lift the conductive cutter. Touching
it sent sparks everywhere, somehow a result of her automated skin. Ella gasped
and dropped it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’ve got
it. Let’s go.” An arcane movement of his hand, and the sword was enveloped in
the same black smoke that seeped from his trench coat. The weapon returned to
his back, divulging his capacity for levitation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“H-How did
you do that?” Ella was referring to his unnatural ability to control the sword
in particular, not to mention his lower’s body’s transition into a hellish
vapor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Simply the
work of my semblance.” He told her. Their trip back to the prison was about as
uneventful as one would expect. Not to worry though, things ramped back to up a
simmer once their goal appeared at hand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The
treatment center’s title was imprinted on a metal archway. Ella read it out and
shivered. They were on the very borders between Vale and the ocean, a colossal
path stretching over the limitless waters towards the complex. Every gate on
the opposite end was opened for Augustus without question. Ella gulped. They
were miles above the reefs. A set of monumental pillars lingered as the only
reason they could rest at ground level rather than plunge into the depths. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Warden.” An
associate greeted the leader upon his entry. “You’re here. We got Dimitri, just

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“He’s of no

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Don’t

every available man we’ve got watching the door.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Don’t be
silly. He’s not leaving the <i>Crypt,</i> you can call them off. There’s plenty
more our force could do than stare at a wall. I’m on my way there anyway.”
Augustus reprimanded the lackey. Before leaving the lobby with his new
accomplice, a visitor caught his eye. “Who are you?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Uh, my

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Really? You

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Only in
training. I-It was nothing.” Her face reddened until she spotted the blue latecomer,
being the first one to notice a pair of bony horns poke from the specter‘s hair.
Her hood was pulled down. “Who’s this?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I found <i>Ella</i>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oh… That’s

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I don’t see

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“No,</i>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Well,
perhaps you can take her to the rehab site.” Augustus gestured for Ella to join
Nadia. “It’s in the East Wing- Sector Two-One-Four. You’ll find it. I’d help
you, but I have my own matters to attend. I’ll notify my staff you’re on your
way. Do this favor, and you can leave by my command- nobody will stop you.” He
was already sailing away. Nadia shrugged at her partner. With a few directions
and perseverance, it wasn’t long before the aforementioned East Wing was reached.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“W-Why help
me? You don’t even know me.” Ella looked away. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Maybe I’m
just fond of you.” Nadia showed off her signature grin, prompting a very meek
Ella to try the same. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Thanks.
Where do <i>you</i> come from?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Beacon
Academy.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Beacon? W-What’s
that?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It’s a
combat school where me and my friends stay. You should come sometime now that
you’re one of them.” Nadia guided her further in, looking for any indication they’d
entered the right place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“F-Friend?
I’ve never had a friend...” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Well, Ella,
it’s an honor to be your first!” She prepped a successful handshake. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“You must be
the ones our Warden warned us about. Nadia and Ella, right?” A patrolman of <i>Sector
Two-One-Four</i> correctly identified them. “We can take it from here.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Alright then.
See you soon!” Nadia let them take her friend away before Ella could voice
dissent. Backtracking was a daunting task, but one that was tackled without any
<i>real</i> setback. On her way out of the lobby, Nadia was reminded of the
enigmatic Warden. The last <i>she’d</i> seen of him, he was levitating down the
chilling penitentiary in search of the Crypt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The thug
waited, one hand holding up his chin and the other tapping the reflective
surface, cuffed to a chain strapped to the wall. There were two things in the Crypt:
A metal block of a table, and Dimitri himself. The place was claustrophobic, a
feat considering a padded cell of this type would generally invoke the opposite
feeling. Red stains settled everywhere, the icing on the cake. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Augustus
entered the room through several doors locked with either keypads, padlocks,
latch sequences, vault cranks, or a combination all four. Each entrance was
locked behind him. “You must be Dimitri. I hope your schedule’s clear.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It is now.”
He grumbled. The smugness persisted even is this disadvantageous position. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“A birdie
told me you knew a lot of about Remnant. A lot of sought after fighters. I
don’t care about that- I’m only interested in a select few.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Eh, if
that’s what it takes for a guy to catch a break in this hotel, I’m all ears.
Fire away.” Dimitri bobbed his head back and forth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Know any
Delphics?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“If you keep
making up words, how am I ever going to answer your gibberish questions?”
Dimitri checked his watch. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Delphics</i>
are a rare creed. Humanoid in nature, they differ in <i>behavior</i> by having
an appearance and instinct mimicking the abilities possessed by Remnant’s most
prehistoric enemy, at one point having been spawned from the darkness- the <i>Creatures
of Grimm.</i> <i>Understand?...</i> Now that I’ve given you information, it’s
your turn to give me the same.” Augustus leaned forward, ready to savor whatever
incoming data his new informant had. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Why the
hell would I know a <i>Delphic?</i> <i>You</i> could be a <i>Delphic</i> for
all I know.” Dimitri seemed agitated, but started laughing at the absurdity of
the situation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I see. Let
me check something, can you hold this for a second?” He held his conductive sword
forward. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Oho! Now <i>that’s</i>
one for the postcards! This’d fit in great with my crowbar! <i>Mind telling me
where it is?”</i> <i>No response. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Augustus was
swiping through his scroll. The cutlass exploded in a frenzy of lightning,
sending arcs of the lethal bolts everywhere. Augustus seemed unaffected, the
zaps having no impact on him, and his glasses blocking the insipid strobe
sensation. One could only imagine how <i>Dimitri</i> felt about it, not only in
the center of the blast, but <i>channeling</i> it, unable to let go. Perhaps
the pain was dulled by the senseless laughing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Time froze
for Dimitri, but flew for his torturer. <i>“Aghh! <b>Hahahahahahaaa!”</b></i> The
torment at long last came to an end. Even though Dimitri was stunned and
temporarily unable to move a muscle in his body, the sword slipped out of his
clenched fingers onto the floor’s fabric. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Not gonna
talk? Okay. That just makes my job better.” Augustus recalled his blade and
rested it on Dimitri’s shoulder. The crime lord dozed out of his slumber with a
howl. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><b><i>“Hahahaha!</i></b><i>
That all you got, Sparky? No, no, I’ll humor you. Repeat the question!” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I just
wanna know where the Delphics are.” He went back to reading random junk on his
scroll, acting unreasonably lax. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“If I knew
where the Delphics are, I’d tell you buddy! What does a guy like me have to
lose from snitching?” Dimitri’s voice suggested he still didn’t have a clue
what a Delphic even was despite the poetic explanation, but either way he
wasn’t <i>afraid</i> of further punishment. He wasn’t going to roll over. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“…Okay. I’ll
undo your chains.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Heehee.
What’s the catch?” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“It might
get in the way, and you need to focus now, because If you want to glimpse the <i>light…”</i>
Augustus was a man of a word, hovering over and unlatching the bond from
Dimitri’s wrist. <i>“You must brave the <b>dark!”</b></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>His bony finger
tapped Dimitri on the shoulder, blasting him with the nightmare mist. The
electrical agony was one thing, <i>this</i> was completely different. A mixture
of purple and red cinders swirled around Dimitri, the charcoal haze
encompassing him.  Like the previous trick, Dimitri could do nothing but jolt
around in place, screaming in hysterics. Thus even as Augustus unlocked every
door sealing the duo inside to leave, escape wasn’t an option. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>“Hmm hm,
hm hmm!”</i> Augustus mumbled his madhouse’s jingle, closing the last door and
sealing the shrieks away. The interrogation continued inside, Dimitri’s misery
presumably unhindered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Tonight had
been a trial for our heroes with inner turmoil, lost souls, and lawless
brawlers. Questions remained the only fruits of their labor. Remnant was
willing to throw these enigmas into the mix without a second thought.
Concerning <i>answers,</i> however, more work would be required.</p>
